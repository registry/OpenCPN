<p><br>
Welcome!<br>
<br>
This is the Documentation for the OpenCPN 4.0 release.<br>
<br>
It is very easy and intuitiv to get started with OpenCPN, the different 
menus, including the clever context sensitive right-click menu, makes it
 likely that you will find what you need.<br>
The program contains a lot of options to fit users with special demands and hardware.<br>
The most frequently asked questions by new users, seen in the OpenCPN Forum <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134">http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134</a>,
 are, in most cases, already answered i this document. If you are going 
to use this program for actual navigation  you need to read through this
 document to fully understand the scope of the program, as well as all 
the details.<br>
If you have difficulties finding a particular subject, please use your 
browser's built-in search ability, often called just "find". This works 
best using the stable release which is all on one web page.<br>
<br>
Press <img alt="" src="images/help.png" align="absMiddle"> and then the help tab to access this built in version of this document.<strong>Links in <em>italic</em> are internal to this document</strong>, except for the table of contents.   Other links will need an Internet connection.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/About32.png" height="362" width="600"><br>
<br>
The installed documentation will open in your default browser.<br>
To download a current snapshot of this wiki as one huge web page, <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/ocpn_manual_export/">click here</a> (only works if you are on line).<br>
<br>
As you can see above, <img alt="" src="images/help.png" align="absMiddle"> also documents the people contributing to OpenCPN and a copy of the license OpenCP uses, GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.<br>
The About tab also tells you where important settings and the log  is located on your system and makes it easy to copy them.<br>
<br>
First before using OpenCPN, here is the note that all users has to approve when installing the program.</p>

<div><em>OpenCPN is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied<br>
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
See the GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN must only be used in conjunction with approved<br>
paper charts and traditional methods of navigation.<br>
<br>
DO NOT rely upon OpenCPN for safety of life or property.</em></div>
<br>
This is not a text on general navigation. We assume that you are 
familiar with nautical navigation.  Reading this text and using OpenCPN 
will not in itself make you a "navigator".<br>
<br>
<strong>Getting started using OpenCPN consists of 3 basic steps:</strong>

<ol>
	<li><a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN </em></a></li>
	<li><a href="#InstallingCharts"><em>Installing Charts</em> </a>to be read by OpenCPN</li>
	<li>*(Optional) <a href="#SettingUpGPS"><em>Setting Up GPS</em></a> to "talk" to your computer and OpenCPN</li>
</ol>
Completing these 3 steps will get you started and allow you to check out
 the program.  Later, after exploring the program, you may want to read 
through the <a href="#BasicFeatures"><em>Basic Features</em> </a>and <a href="#AdvancedFeatures"><em>Advanced Features</em> </a>sections to really get a good grasp of what the program offers. <br>
If you still have questions or would just like to get in touch with 
other OpenCPN users, there is also a fairly large community behind 
OpenCPN. You can find us in this <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/">Cruisers Forum.</a><br>
<br>
* For advanced users we recommend the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual">Developers Manual</a>.<br>

<h4 id="32/64 bit Fedora / Cent OS">32/64 bit Fedora / Cent OS</h4>
<br>
If you are installing OpenCPN for the first time on a computer with 
Ubuntu, or any other Linux flavor, you have to go through a few steps to
 make sure that all dependencies are met. Ubuntu uses "deb" packages and
 Fedora uses the "rpm" packages.
<ul>
	<li>For Debian based Linuxes: <strong>Make sure that you belong to the "dialout" group.</strong> To find out, run the "$groups" command. If you're not in "dialout", add yourself with the command <strong>"$sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER"</strong>.
 Check this straight away, it will save you from frustration later on. 
If there is a problem connecting the GPS to a physical port, such as 
/dev/ttyS0, the reason is probably that you don't belong to "dialout".</li>
	<li>For other Linux distributions, replace "dialout" above, with the result of this command: $stat -c %G /dev/ttyS0</li>
	<li><strong>It is recommended that you install the "xcalib" program, that is necessary to dim the screen for night time usage.</strong> Use your favourite package manager or just issue <em>$sudo apt-get install xcalib </em>from the command line (for debian based distros).</li>
	<li><strong>It is recommended that you install the "xdg-utils" program, that helps the grib plugin compose a SailDoc grib-request-mail.</strong> Use your favourite package manager or just issue <em>$sudo apt-get install xdg-utils </em>from the command line (for debian based distros).</li>
	<li>On Ubuntu, start "System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Synaptic". In 
Synaptic  go to "Settings-&gt;Repositories" and tick the box 
"Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)". Close Synaptic.</li>
	<li>Download the correct .deb or .rpm from <a href="http://opencpn.org/download">Download OpenCPN</a>.</li>
	<li>For Ubuntu, only use the download with an Ubuntu version number if you have exactly that version. Otherwise use the link "<a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eopencpn/+archive/opencpn">Download </a>OpenCPN 3.X.X for all other *Ubuntu's".</li>
	<li>Use the stable release for navigation en route, or if you just started using OpenCPN.</li>
	<li>Click on the downloaded package. An installation manager will guide
 you on most Linux distributions. All dependencies should automatically 
be installed. <strong>For most Linux installations, this is all you have to do.</strong> Consult the following 3 paragraphs if you run into trouble.</li>
	<li>If you have problems with dependencies, run the recommended command
 line in the next paragraph. First check that you really have downloaded
 the correct version of OpenCPN. se above.</li>
	<li>sudo gdebi<span> </span>&lt;downloaded_opencpn_file.deb&gt;. The command "gdebi" will automatically install the dependencies for you.</li>
	<li>It is also possible to install the package via dpkg or rpm, on the 
condition that all dependencies are met.To make sure that this is the 
case on Ubuntu, open a terminal window to get a command line, 
(Applications-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Terminal) and copy and paste the 
following line: "<em>sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0  libwxbase2.8-0 wx-common  libglu1-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx zlib1g bzip2 gpsd gpsd-clients </em><em>xcalib</em> <em>xdg-utils libportaudio2</em> <em>libkml0 libtinyxml2.6.2 liburiparser1 zlib1g libexpat1</em>". Then proceed with the commands below
	<ul>
		<li>
		<pre>For Ubuntu: $ sudo dpkg -i &lt;downloaded_file.deb&gt; 
For Fedora: # sudo yum install --nogpgcheck &lt;downloaded_file.rpm&gt;</pre>
		</li>
		<li>The binary will be installed to <strong>/</strong><strong>usr/bin/opencpn</strong> and the static data used by the program will be in <strong>/usr/share/opencpn  </strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If this is a new installation, click on the Options icon <img alt="Toolbox Settings" src="images/settings_003.png" align="absMiddle"> and configure your GPS source, chart directories, and other settings.</li>
	<li><strong>If there is a problem with sound</strong>, make sure that 
you, as a user, belongs to the "audio" group. To find out, run the 
"$groups" command. If you're not in "audio", add yourself with "$sudo 
usermod -a -G audio $USER"</li>
	<li>If you are running Debian Squeeze and want to install OpenCPN from 
the distributions .deb package, you will need to install with something 
like this in order to satisfy install dependencies related to 
libtinyxml:<br>
	$sudo dpkg -i --force-depends opencpn_3.1.1327-1_i386.deb</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Using Linux repositories, an easier way to install and update.">Using Linux repositories, an easier way to install and update.</h3>

<p>Installing in a different, easy way.</p>

<h4 id="InstallingonUbuntu">Installing on Ubuntu</h4>

<p>Have a look at opencpn on <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eopencpn/+archive/opencpn">launchpad.net.</a><br>
The launchpad site can be used as a repository, and let OpenCPN be 
downloaded and updated the mainstream Ubuntu way. The X86 architecture 
has always been supported. From early autumn 2014 experimental  packages
 for ARM  will be available as well.<br>
Add repositories in, for example, Synaptic, like this:<br>
10.04<br>
=====<br>
- Add the following Software Sources: PPA from<br>
<a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eopencpn/+archive/opencpn" title="https://launchpad.net/~opencpn/+archive/opencpn">https://launchpad.net/~opencpn/+archive/opencpn</a>, universe, lucid-backports<br>
- In Synaptic, reload the software sources as it suggests, search for<br>
and install opencpn<br>
- No need to install anything manually<br>
11.04<br>
=====<br>
- Add the following Software Sources: PPA from<br>
<a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eopencpn/+archive/opencpn" title="https://launchpad.net/~opencpn/+archive/opencpn">https://launchpad.net/~opencpn/+archive/opencpn</a>, multiverse, universe,<br>
natty-backports<br>
- In Synaptic, reload the software sources as it suggests, search for<br>
and install opencpn<br>
- No need to install anything manually</p>

<h4 id="InstallingonFedora">Installing on Fedora</h4>

<p>A full repo is now available and can be used to install and update opencpn.<br>
To install the repo, please run this as root:<br>
yum install <a href="http://je.onfray.fr/repo/fedora/18/x86_64/jeo-release-1.0-1.fc18.noarch.rpm" title="http://je.onfray.fr/repo/fedora/18/x86_64/jeo-release-1.0-1.fc18.noarch.rpm">http://je.onfray.fr/repo/fedora/18/x86_64/jeo-release-1.0-1.fc18.noarch.rpm</a><br>
You can install the above rpm, no matter if you're using i386 or x86_64,
 be it Fedora 16, Fedora 17 or Fedora 18, it'll work on all these (you 
should be able to install it right from your browser clicking the above 
link and then install)<br>
By default, only the stable repo is enabled ; you can install 
opencpn-4.0 from your favorite package manager (yum, Gnome package kit 
or KDE package kit). I've created two separate packages: "opencpn" with 
the program and the two default plugins and "opencpn-doc" with the whole
 html doc to browse it offline.<br>
When a new stable is released, you'll be automatically notified and able to update... so easy!<br>
<br>
Security/Trust: all packages are signed with Key ID 7e53dbe19add462d</p>

<ul>
	<li>Currently other distributions requires compiling the source. This 
will involve resolving various dependencies and is for folks comfortable
 with developing on Linux.</li>
	<li>Download the source from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencpn/files/opencpn/2.3.1/OpenCPN-2.3.1-Source.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net </a>or directly from the Git server.

<ul>
	<li><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>Installation OpenCPN on</span> <span>Mac</span> <span>OS</span> <span>X</span> <span>is no different from</span> <span>installing other</span> <span>programs</span>. <span>If a</span> <span>previous version</span> <span>is installed</span><span>, rename the old</span> <span>version</span> <span>(app</span><span>) file</span> <span>to</span> <span>avoid overwriting</span><span>.</span> </span></li>
	<li>The Mac package is a ".dmg" file, and to install OpenCPN, the dmg 
file has to be opened (it will mount as a virtual device) and the app 
icon in the opened device window must be dragged and dropped to the 
application folder.<br>
	After that the device window can be closed and the mounted virtual device can be ejected.</li>
	<li>You can have a look at <a href="http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tips-shortcuts/how-to-install-and-properly-remove-apps/">this tutorial</a> for general instructions on installing an application on Mac OS X.</li>
	<li>If you have a message, that  installations are only accepted for 
programs from qualified developers, go to System Settings / Security, 
first Tab, and switch to "No Constraints".<br>
	After installation switch back, to prevent installation of malware.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="DifferentversionsofOpenCPN">Different versions of OpenCPN</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Use a "stable", official release for actual navigation. The latest 
stable release is always available at the top of the download page or 
from Source Forge.</li>
	<li>Beta releases are snapshots of the development process, and may 
contain errors or temporarily be unstable. Show stoppers are normally 
fixed very quickly however. This is where the latest features first are 
seen. Most of the time the beta releases are quite stable and the 
OpenCPN team appreciate it if more experienced users test the releases 
and report back.</li>
	<li>The place to report bugs and suggest features is <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a>. To reach <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a>
 from the OpenCPN Web pages click on the "Tracker" tab at the upper 
right (above the blue bar).  The sticky thread "Tracker/Flyspray - How 
and When to use it" (tab Forum) is giving some hints.<br>
	 </li>
	<li>To see what version you are using either look in  
?-&gt;about or at the top of your display. A lot of information is also 
available in the log file. See below.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="images/2624.png" align="top" height="92" width="284"></li>
</ul>
<br>
(#log-config)<br>
<br>
 
<h3 id="Location of Important Files. Log and config files."><strong><a id="#"></a>Location of Important Files. Log and config files.</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li> It is important to know the location of the <strong>log file</strong> and the configuration file,<strong> opencpn.conf</strong>(Linux)<strong> </strong>or<strong> opencpn.ini</strong>
 (Windows), on your computer. If you ask questions on the forum, there 
is a fair chance that you will be asked about the content in these 
files. Once you get familiar with OpenCPN, have a look at the files!</li>
	<li>Through out this documentation there will be many references to the
 configuration file, as it often is possible to change the default 
settings. This is an advanced subject once you are familiar with 
OpenCPN. All editing in the config files must be done with a 
text-editor, such as "notepad" in Windows.</li>
	<li>The configuration file is where all data, that needs to be 
persistent between sessions, are stored. The logfile keeps tab of what's
 going on in the current session.                       </li>
	<li>To find the locations of the files go to the ToolBar click on 
"About OpenCPN", the button looks like a blue book with a "?" on the 
cover. Look at the bottom  of the "About" Tab, highlighted below. The 
illustration below is from a Win XP. A quick way to view the logfile is 
to copy the full file path and then paste this into the address field in
 a web browser.<br>
	<br>
	<img alt="" src="images/help_1.png" height="507" width="500"></li>
	<li>For quick copying of the opencpn.ini and Log files use the two 
"Copy" buttons. This is useful for publishing on the forum if asked to 
do so. Please use the Forum "Code" button  before pasting, as this 
guarantees an exact copy.</li>
	<li>On <strong>Linux</strong> the "opencpn.log" is in your home directory.<br>
	The "opencpn.conf" is in a hidden directory, called "opencpn", also in your home directory.<br>
	For a quick way to view the files you can try these commands.<br>
	$gedit `echo $HOME/opencpn.log`<br>
	$gedit `echo $HOME/.opencpn/opencpn.conf`<br>
	Of course you can swap "gedit" for your favorite editor.</li>
	<li>On <strong><strong>Windows 7, </strong>Windows 2000, XP and Vista </strong>the
 two files are more difficult to find, so use the "About" dialog as 
described above. On many windows installs the folder containing the 
logfile will also be <strong>hidden</strong>, so you need to change your systems "Folder Options" to show it.</li>
</ul>

<div>For example, the C:\ProgramData folder is by default hidden in Windows 7. Here's how to get to it:<br>
<br>
To access it you need to un-hide it by doing the following:<br>
<br>
1. Go to <b>Control Panel &gt; Folder Options</b><br>
2. Switch to <b>View </b>tab<br>
3. Select "Show hidden files, folders and drives".<br>
4. Unselect "Hide extensions for know file types" to get this state:<img alt="" src="images/folderoptions.png" height="302" width="367"><br>
<br>
Now you will be able to find your logfile.<br>
 </div>

<ul>
	<li><span id="result_box" lang="en"><span>On </span><strong><span>Mac</span> <span>OS</span> <span>X</span></strong><span>, the logfile, </span><span>"opencpn.log"</span>, is <span>in  /</span><span>Users</span><span>/</span>"<span>user</span> <span>name"</span><span>/Library</span><span>/</span><span>Logs</span><span>/</span> <span>and the </span><span>"opencpn.ini</span>" is <span>in the /</span><span>Users</span><span>/</span>"<span>user</span> <span>name"</span><span>/Library</span><span>/Preferences</span><span>/ directory.</span></span></li>

<ul>
	<li>If you have installed OpenCPN successfully and later run into 
trouble there is generally no point in reinstalling. It is a very common
 reaction among users, but achieves very little.</li>
	<li>If openCPN refuses to start, or hangs after the introduction dialog <strong>and</strong>
 you have Intel integrated graphics on your computer, try to start the 
program from the command-line  with  -&gt; "opencpn -no_opengl"</li>
	<li>
	<div>Still no luck? Proceed by checking your logfile and try to find a hint there.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>Next step is to close down OpenCPN, if it's still running. Then save any possibly valuable data. Read about <a href="#NavigationDataBackup"><em>Navigation Data Backup</em></a></div>
	</li>
	<li>Proceed by renaming the configuration file - opencpn.ini to , for 
example, opencpn_OLD.ini.  When you start OpenCPN again it will be like a
 new install, no chart directories and all settings are default.</li>
	<li>If you still have problems, and especially if your log file 
complains about navobj.xml files, close down OpenCPN and move all 
navobj.xml files to another directory. Rename the opencpn.ini file 
again, and then restart as before. If successful, close down again, and 
try to move, first the navobj.xml.1 back to the original directory 
renaming it navobj.xml. If not successful, try navobj.xml.2 etc This 
last step is only necessary if you have valuable data that's not saved 
elsewhere.</li>
	<li>
	<div>If this is successful, please post your old config file and your

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
<strong>What is OpenGL an Overview</strong><br>
OpenGL is an open standard, cross platform, advanced graphic library. It
 uses the graphic cards processor (GPU) and memory, to speed up 
applications. With OpenCPN a user with a typical modern graphic card 
will have an enhanced experience. Much faster and smoother zooming and 
panning as well as clearer and sharper chart rendering.<br>
<br>
In OpenCPN OpenGL is a choice, the old graphic engine is still there. 
OpenGL will not work for everyone. Performance may not be improved with 
embedded graphics chips, often found in older laptops and netbooks.<br>
<br>
Microsoft has gone from support to hostility towards OpenGL. There is 
currently a lot of trouble Windows for all OpenGL applications, not just
 OpenCPN. OpenCPN has been forced to disable a handfull of OpenGL 
features for all Intel OpenGL graphics drivers on Windows, for example.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="short_text" id="result_box" lang="en"><span>Mac</span> <span>OS</span> <span>X</span> <span>has full</span> <span>supports</span> for <span>OpenGL</span><span>.</span></span><br>
<br>
For Linux the situation is slightly different. Linux supports OpenGL, as
 it generally tends to support open standards. The user is however 
dependent on a driver from the graphic cards maker, and their support 
for OpenGL. This may change with projects like <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/">nouveau</a>, a free driver for nVidias cards.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/nogl.png" height="167" width="200">        <img alt="" src="images/gl.png" height="172" width="200"><br>
Without OpenGL                         With OpenGL<br>
Heavy over zooming reveals some of the secrets behind OpenGL<br>
 <br>
<strong>Why introduce OpenGL in OpenCPN?</strong><br>
The main reasons are:
<ul>
	<li>Better performance, leveraging modern PC graphics cards that are ubiquitous and powerful.</li>
	<li>Better "eye candy", such as smooth zoom and pan, with little impact on responsiveness.</li>
	<li>Future cross-platform support (e.g Android/IOS)</li>
	<li>Some features depends on OpenGL, such as horizontal text and numbers on skewed (course up) vectorcharts.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Is OpenGL a good choice for everyone?</strong><br>
OpenCPNs performance with OpenGL is highly dependent upon your graphics hardware and drivers.
<ul>
	<li>On some systems using Intel HD Graphics adapters, especially 
running 64bit editions of Windows 7, OpenCPN gets killed due to errors 
in the display adapter drivers. You may try to get updated drivers or as
 a workaround, on Windows run <strong>OpenCPN - no OpenGL</strong> from Start menu. On all the platforms, you can use the <strong>-no_opengl</strong> command line switch while starting the program to run it with OpenGL disabled.</li>
	<li>Some graphics chip sets (e.g.intel 945G) have rather poor OpenGL 
driver support, so that we cannot fully utilize the hardware 
acceleration potential of these systems.</li>
	<li>nVidia graphics, even very old cards, seem to perform very well.</li>
	<li>Performance may not be improved with embedded graphics chips as often found in older laptops and netbooks.</li>
	<li>There is a lot of trouble with OpenGL on Vista and W7. Microsoft 
implemented a new screen compositing model for Vista and later, which 
"broke" many OpenGL apps</li>
	<li>Conclusion:Using OpenGL with OpenCPN will be a significant upgrade 
for some users of OpenCPN, but OpenGL may not be "better" for everyone's
 OCPN application.</li>
	<li>So, user's choice. If OpenGL works better for you, then use it. If 
not, the old DC based graphics render system is still in place.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Start using OpenGL</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Find the latest driver for your graphic card. The driver that came 
with your operating system, is not likely to be the best. Start looking 
at your graphic card makers home page.</li>
	<li>Go to the ToolBox-&gt;Settings and tick the two boxes "Use 
Accelerated Graphics(OpenGL)" and "Enable Smooth Panning/Zooming".  Read
 all the details in the <em><a href="#SettingOptions">Setting Options</a></em> display tab.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other tricks</strong><br>
If you have a lot of graphic memory, or very little, try to add the following to your config (ini on windows) file:<br>
"GPUMemorySize=nnn"<br>
where nnn is graphics card memory size, in MBytes.<br>
256 MBytes is the default.<br>

  <h1 id="LowPowerSystems" class="book-heading">Low Power Systems</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is an advanced subject. Beginners
 need only bother, if they have a system with very low resources and if 
the system feels very sluggish. The background is that OpenCPN, quite 
aggressively uses memory, to speed up the application, this can backfire
 in certain situations....<br>
<br>
There is a simple memory management scheme, for use with systems that has limited resources.<br>
Two modes are available, only one of which can be active at any given 
time. The mode must be specified in the "opencpn.conf" file, called 
"opencpn.ini" in Windows and Mac.<br>
<br>
1. Application memory limit target. Try to limit the total memory used by OCPN to the specified value, approximately.<br>
Specify this mode by:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
MEMCacheLimit=xxx<br>
......<br>
Where xxx is memory use target in Mbytes. Overrides NCacheLimit below.<br>
<br>
2. Open chart limit. This is the default mode under Linux, and the default value is 20 open charts at any one time.<br>
<br>
Modify this limit by the following:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
NCacheLimit=yy<br>
......<br>
Where yy is the maximum number of simultaneously open charts.<br>
<br>
If you do not enter any memory management specification in the config file, the following defaults apply:<br>
<br>
a. Linux systems has a soft memory limit at 50% of available RAM. Open chart limit is 20 charts.<br>
b. Windows and Mac...Application memory limit target is used. Target 
limit is 50% of available physical RAM, up to a maximum of 1 gigabyte.<br>
 
<h4 id="Settings for increased speed.">Settings for increased speed.</h4>
In Options-&gt;Display-Advanced tab  activate "Disable Full Screen 
Quilting" to start with. Use OpenGL if your hardware is up to it. If you
 are using OpenGL on a low-spec machine, you will have better 
performance if you<br>
a) disable texture caching, or<br>
b) Pre-build the texture cache in a region of interest. That is, move 
the boat to say Dover. Then do 
Options-&gt;Advanced&gt;(OpenGL)Options-&gt;Build Texture Cache. You do 
not need to wait the entire time, which may be hours for a large chart 
set. "Skip" out when the distance reported is 100 miles or so.<br>
Eventually, after steady use, your texture cache will be filled 
automatically in the background, and performance will increase steadily.<br>

  <h1 id="PortableOpenCPN" class="book-heading">Portable OpenCPN </h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The OpenCPN portable option allows the
 program to run from an USB stick, or run independent from, and parallel
 to a normal installation. On Windows, it is not possible to run 
concurrent instances of OpenCPN, unless using the portable option.<br>
To differ between various instances of the program, the titlebar on portable versions looks like this.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/portable.png" height="31" width="605"><br>
It is thus possible to run multiple portable instances and identify each version.<br>
 
<h3 id="To create a portable Windows version (across only 32-bit or only 64-bit systems)">To create a portable Windows version (across only 32-bit <u><em>or</em></u> only 64-bit systems)</h3>
<br>
1. Create a new directory dedicated to the portable OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
2. In a separate window, navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenCPN (on 
64-bit systems) or C:\Program Files\OpenCPN (on 32-bit systems), and <u>copy</u> (don't move) the following <u>data directories</u> (with containing files) into this new direcory:

<ul>
	<li>doc/</li>
	<li>plugins/</li>
	<li>s57data/</li>
	<li>share/</li>
	<li>sounds/</li>
	<li>tcdata/</li>
	<li>uidata/</li>
	<li>wvsdata/ (only for OpenCPN 3.2.0 and earlier)</li>
</ul>
<br>
3. From the same OpenCPN folder, copy the following <u>files</u> into the new directory:

<ul>
	<li>crashrpt_lang.ini</li>
	<li>CrashRpt1401.dll</li>
	<li>CrashSender1401.exe</li>
	<li>license.txt</li>
	<li>OpenCPN.exe (of course)</li>
	<li>Eight wxWidgets dlls beginning with the name "wxbase"</li>
</ul>
<br>
4. Now navigate to C:\Windows\SysWOW64 (on 64-bit systems) or 
C:\Windows\System32 (on 32-bit systems) and copy the following files 
into the new directory:
<ul>
	<li>msvcp100.dll</li>
	<li>msvcr100.dll</li>
</ul>
<br>
5. If running Windows, create MSDOS batch file "opencpn portable.bat" (or other name of user choice) containing the one line:<br>
<br>
"opencpn -p" (without quotes)<br>
<br>
This file must be in the new directory. If you want your batch file to 
be in a different directory, you must edit the batch file to include 
"cd" commands to navigate into the new directory before the line 
containing the "opencpn -p" command.<br>
<br>
To run OpenCPN portably within this directory, simply execute the 
"opencpn portable" batch file. There may be a way to build a click-able 
shortcut to OpenCPN, with the -p option specified in the shortcut. But I
 could not figure it out. Windows insists upon a drive letter in the 
command line of the shortcut, which would defeat the whole purpose of 
portability.Thus, the batch file....<br>
<br>
If the charts are also in the current dir, then the entire installation 
is "portable", meaning there are no hard-coded drive letter 
dependencies, and all write activities occur in the current dir only.<br>
<br>
This setup works very well from a USB stick.<br>
 
<h3 id="Alternate procedure to use the 64-bit libraries upon demand">Alternate procedure to use the 64-bit libraries upon demand</h3>
<br>
The setup described above will work on 32- or 64-bit systems, as long as
 you are careful to copy msvcp100.dll and msvcr100.dll from the exact 
folders that were specified. Those files are 32-bit libraries, which 
will run without problems on both 32- and 64-bit systems.<br>
<br>
If you accidentally copied the <u>64-bit</u> msvc*100.dll library files (which are located in C:\Windows\System32 on <u>64-bit </u>systems)
 a 32-bit system, you will get an error message when trying to run in 
portable mode. If you want cross-compatibility between 32- and 64-bit 
systems, it is strongly suggested to use the 32-bit libraries described 
in step 4 above.<br>
<br>
If you insist on using 64-bit libraries on 64-bit systems, but want to 
preserve 32-bit compatibility on 32-bit systems, you can do the 
following setup procedure which creates separate batch files for the 
32-bit and 64-bit versions of msvcr100.dll and msvcp100.dll in the 
OpenCPN root directory as described here:<br>
<br>
1. Same as above<br>
2. Same as above<br>
3. Same as above<br>
<br>
4. Create MSDOS batch files "opencpn portable 32.bat" and "opencpn 
portable 64.bat" (or other names of user choice that distinguish between
 the 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems).<br>
<br>
In the MSDOS batch file "opencpn portable 32.bat", add the following lines (without quotes):<br>
"copy msvcp100_32bit.dll msvcp100.dll /Y"<br>
"copy msvcr100_32bit.dll msvcr100.dll /Y"<br>
"opencpn -p"<br>
<br>
In the MSDOS batch file "opencpn portable 64.bat", add the following lines (without quotes):<br>
"copy msvcp100_64bit.dll msvcp100.dll /Y"<br>
"copy msvcr100_64bit.dll msvcr100.dll /Y"<br>
"opencpn -p"<br>
<br>
5. Copy msvcp100.dll from the 32-bit system and rename it msvcp100_32bit.dll<br>
    Copy msvcr100.dll from the 32-bit system and rename it msvcr100_32bit.dll<br>
<br>
6. Copy msvcp100.dll from the 64-bit system and rename it msvcp100_64bit.dll<br>
    Copy msvcr100.dll from the 64-bit system and rename it msvcr100_64bit.dll<br>
<br>
To run OpenCPN portably on a Windows 32-bit system, execute the "opencpn portable 32" batch file.<br>
To run OpenCPN portably on a Windows 64-bit system, execute the "opencpn portable 64" batch file.

<br>
A Linux version</h3>
<br>
On Linux, a similar functionality exists. The 32 and 64 bits issue is similar.<br>
32 bits version can be made to work on a 64 bits Linux by installing  
ia32-libs or multiarch support packages. The opposit way, a 64 bit 
version on a 32 bit system, will not work.<br>
Copy the opencpn executable binary and the data directories mentioned above to a local directory.<br>
In that directory, do<br>
$ ./opencpn -p<br>
This will cause all user data files to be created and used from within that local directory.<br>
This can be useful for side-by-side testing...<br>

<br>
<strong>Make sure your GPS is set to output positions using the WGS 84 Geodetic Datum.</strong> This is less of an issue nowadays, compared to, say 10 - 15 years ago.<br>
Some units can't be changed, and is permanently set to WGS 84. The BU-353 is one of those.<br>
<br>
 
<h2 id="Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7"><strong>Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7</strong></h2>
<br>
Note that the extensive use of the cheap gps mouse BU-353 as an example below, should only be seen as an illustration.<br>
 
<p>To use OpenCPN with a GPS, a GPS receiver is needed.</p>

<p>There are a variety of possible choices for a GPS receiver:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A computer, such as a Sony Vaio P has a built in GPS receiver</li>
	<li>A NMEA Expander to amplify a nmea stream to multiple listeners</li>
	<li>A hand-held GPS receiver</li>
	<li>A dedicated GPS receiver</li>
</ul>

<p>The remainder of this section describes using OpenCPN with a 
dedicated GPS receiver, however, the instructions for a dedicated 
receiver will be similar for any serial/USB connected NMEA data stream.</p>

<h4 id="ADedicatedGPSReceiver">A Dedicated GPS Receiver</h4>

<p>There are several companies making dedicated GPS receivers. The 
Supplementary Hardware section for GPS devices lists several 
manufacturers.</p>

<p>NMEA has traditionally been implemented as a serial protocol and 
therefore, even if a USB connection is used, there needs to be a USB to 
Serial Port conversion. The specific driver for the each GPS receiver 
will handle this conversion.<br>
 </p>

<h4 id="An Example - Configuring BU-353">An Example - Configuring BU-353</h4>

<p> It is not necessary to use the installation disk to setup the 
BU-353. Following the steps listed below will result in the latest 
driver being installed.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download the latest driver from Prolific - <a href="http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A" title="http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A">http://www.usglobalsat.com/s-24-support-drivers.aspx#A</a></li>
	<li>Unzip and install the driver</li>
	<li>Plug in the BU-353.</li>
	<li>Start -&gt; (Right Click) My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Hardware -&gt;Device Manager<br>
	or Start-&gt;Run devmgmt.msc</li>
	<li>Expand Ports</li>
	<li>Look for the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port” and note the com port number (e.g., COM4) <img alt="" src="images/DeviceManager-1.jpg" align="textTop" height="610" width="410"></li>
	<li> </li>
	<li>Right click on the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port”. Choose Driver</li>
	<li>Select 4800 bits per second, 8 data bits, None parity, 1 stop bit, and None for Flow Control  <img alt="" src="images/Prolific.jpg" align="textTop" height="450" width="410"></li>
	<li> </li>
	<li>Start OpenCPN</li>
	<li>Click on the Options Icon  <img alt="Toolbox Settings" src="images/settings_003.png"></li>
	<li>Select "Connections", and "Add Connection" and "Serial"</li>
	<li>Under "Data Port" select the Com port noted in #6</li>
	<li>Choose OK</li>
	<li>Select Auto Follow to center the map over your GPS location</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>There is a small LED located on the BU-353. If the LED is off there is no power being received. Check the connection.</p>

<p>If the LED is solid it indicates the BU-353 is searching for a GPS signal. Try moving the GPS receiver to a clear location.</p>

<p>If the LED is flashing it indicates the BU-353 has a position fix and is transmitting data.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Try viewing the NMEA data stream in OpenCPN. Choose Options-&gt;Connections-&gt;Show NMEA Debug Window</li>
	<li>Alternatively, a diagnostic program is included on the installation
 CD called GPSInfo.exe. Launch this program to install the diagnostic 
utility.</li>
</ol>

<p>If it appears that the NMEA data stream is being received, the most 
likely issue is that OpenCPN is not centered over your location. Click 
AutoFollow to center the map at your GPS location.</p>

<p>If you change the USB port for the GPS receiver Prolific will 
reassign the COM port number. This will require repeating steps 4-12 
above.</p>

<p>On some computer / GPS receiver combinations when the computer 
resumes from Stand By the GPS receiver will no longer transmit its NMEA 
data stream, and only garbage instead of ASCII characters will be 
visible in the NMEA Data Stream Window. The red indicator led will not 
work.<br>
<br>
To change back to NMEA mode search for and download SIRFDemo.exe.<br>
Unpack and start. Set correct Baud rate and and com port as above.<br>
Click connect to data source button. Action -&gt; Switch to NMEA protocol, then exit.<br>
There are many more settings available in SIRFDemo.exe</p>

<p>An alternative workaround for this issue is provided by using a COM port splitter such as XPort <a href="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html" title="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html">http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html</a></p>

	<li>Unzip it to a folder of your choice</li>
	<li>Double Click XPort.exe</li>
	<li>Set the Baud Rate to 4800</li>
	<li>Under Enable Ports add an entry for COM10</li>
	<li>Click “Find GPS”. The port returned should match the port identified in Step #6 in the Configuring BU-353 Section</li>

<p>To proceed, the "user" you use on your computer must belong to a 
group that is allowed to open serial connections. This group is normally
 "dialout" on Debian based Linuxes, including Ubuntu, and "uucp" on Red 
Hat based distributions. Read more in <em><a href="#DataConnections">Data Connections</a></em>.<br>
Check your status by writing "groups" on a command line. The response 
will be all groups that the user belongs to. Make sure that "dialout" or
 "uucp" is included. If not, you have to add your user to this group. 
There are many ways to do this, one is to issue this command:<br>
"sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER"<br>
This applies to many Debian based distibutions, for other distros just drop the sudo and do the command as root, using "su".<br>
All major Linux distribution includes a graphical user settings dialog, where adding a user to a group, could be fixed.</p>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Go to Options-&gt; Connections-&gt; Add Conection and select

	<li>On Ubuntu 10.04 and later, that is really all you have to do. When you plug in your gps this will trigger gpsd to start.</li>
	<li>"xgps" is client that comes with the gpsd-clients package, and is 
useful for testing that the gps and gpsd is working properly. If xgps 
isn't working, it's a gps or gpsd problem, not an OpenCPN problem</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Direct connection.">Direct connection.</h5>

<ul>
	<li> Make sure that gpsd isn't running then connect your gps and start 
OpenCPN. On Ubuntu 12.04 the easiest way to achive this is to unistall 
gpsd.</li>
	<li>In the Options-&gt;Connections -&gt; Add Conection, select 
"Serial".Set "dataPort to the port where you plugged in your gps. If you
 plugged in BU 353 this will probably be /dev/ttyUSB0.</li>
	<li>Choose 4800 baud, unless you know that the gps is set to something else.</li>
	<li>The gps should now work....if not, check the NMEA data stream 
window. If only binary garbage is visible, the gps has to be reset to 
NMEA mode, see more about this above in windows section. An alternative 
is to use gpsd, that will work with the gps in Sirf mode.</li>
	<li>To do this in Linux for BU 353 as well as many other gps:es, make 
sure that gpsd is running  and that the package "gpsd-clients" is 
installed. On Ubuntu 12.04 gpsd needs to be temporarily installed. Make 
sure to kill any instances of gpsd with the command "sudo killall gpsd"</li>
	<li>The command $gpsctl -n will put the GPS into NMEA mode.</li>
	<li>If that doesn't work, try $ gpsctl -f -n  /dev/ttyUSB0 .This will 
force a low-level access, bypassing gpsd. For more information: $man 
gpsctl</li>
	<li>More information is as always available through "man gpsctl" Close down OpenCPN before running gpsctl.<br>
	          <br>
	None of this is normally noticed when using gpsd, as this program reads both NMEA and SIRF binary sentences.</li>

the command "groups". Not all Linux distributions add the user to this 
group by default. To add your self to the dialout group -&gt; "sudo

	This or similar responses indicate that gpsd is running. If you only 
have something like the second line, ....it is not running.</li>
	<li>Run the command "$ls -lrtd /dev/*|tail -10", and see the 10 latest 
created device files. Run this just after plugin in your gps to see 
which device was created.<br>
	 </li>
	<li>Determine which device your GPS is on your linux system by checking
 the startup.  Look for a line that says something about GPS and 
/dev/ttyUSB#  <span>in the command</span> "dmesg"</li>
	<li>Or even better, after connecting a gps mouse, BU-353, we look for a dmesg by running this command.
	<pre>$ dmesg | grep tty
and get this response back.

More user experience of setting up bluetooth GPS are welcome, as the 
notes below just reflects a few users experience. Please use the Forum.

<p> </p>

<h4 id="Ubuntu 10.10 and older.">Ubuntu 10.10 and older.</h4>
If you have a bluetooth GPS  you will need to first configure it through
 the standard Ubuntu Bluetooth "set up new device " proceedure. Once you
 have done that you will need to find what the address of the GPS is. To
 do that you run this command:<br>
<br>
"sudo hcitool scan"<br>
<br>
it will then start looking for the Bluetooth GPS and hopefully find your GPS. You should see something similar to:<br>
<br>
Scanning ...<br>
    00:1C:88:10:D3:4D    iBT-GPS<br>
<br>
In this case i have a IBT-GPS at address     00:1C:88:10:D3:4D   (Your GPS address will be different)<br>
<br>
Next we have to bind the GPS address to a "virtual" device OpenCPN 
understands in this case rfcomm0. We do this with the following command:<br>
<br>
sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D        Note put your GPS address in this line<br>
<br>
You should not have to run these commands each time your linux is restarted as it will remeber your GPS address.<br>
<br>
Now all you need to do is go into OpenCPN Toolbox and select GPS. Now in
 the NMEA Data Source options select from the pulldown menu: 
"/dev/rfcomm0", or write it in the box, if not present as an 
alternative.<br>
<br>
Thats it - you should now have a Bluetooth GPS Connected.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ubuntu</strong><strong> 12.04</strong><br>
-Pair GPS with bluetooth icon<br>
-break connection with bluetooth icon<br>
-get device id: sudo hcitool scan<br>
-get channel for gps: sdptool records 00:02:78:0A:4E:E9 (put your actual number here)<br>
-sudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf  #edit rfcomm input file. Text should be:

	# RFCOMM configuration file.
	#
	# $Id: rfcomm.conf,v 1.1 2002/10/07 05:58:18 maxk Exp $
	#

	rfcomm0 {
	        # Automatically bind the device at startup
	        bind yes;

	        # Bluetooth address of the device
	        device xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;

	        # RFCOMM channel for the connection
	        channel 1;#use channel number as provided by sdptool records XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

	        # Description of the connection
	        comment "Your GPS Device Here";
	}</pre>
- sudo rfcomm release 0 (not strictly neccesary)<br>
- sudo rfcomm connect 0 (you only need to to this once, not required if you reboot at this point)<br>
...connected /dev/rfcomm0 to 00:00:00:00:00:00 (whatever)<br>
...Press CTRL-C for hangup<br>
in a seperate terminal, you can test the connection with rfcomm show /dev/rfcomm0<br>
...rfcomm0: 00:08:1B:14:18:B6 channel 1 connected [tty-attached]<br>
your bluetooth GPS should now be working in open CPN. run sudo opencpn 
to check that it works (/dev/rfcomm0 under GPS NMEA data source).<br>
if it works, try  running opencpn without sudo, chances are that you 
cannot see the gps. if this is the case, use the following fix: sudo 
usermod -a -G dialout $USER<br>
 
<h4 id="Fedora">Fedora</h4>
Run "hcitool scan" to get the ID of your bluetooth gps device<br>
Make a file "rfcomm.config" and put it in /etc/bluetooth.<br>
This file is already present in Ubuntu, but needs editing for persistent connection.<br>
<br>
# RFCOMM configuration file.<br>
#<br>
# $Id: rfcomm.conf,v 1.1 2002/10/07 05:58:18 maxk Exp $<br>
#<br>
rfcomm0 {<br>
# Automatically bind the device at startup<br>
bind yes;<br>
# Bluetooth address of the device<br>
device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX;<br>
# RFCOMM channel for the connection<br>
channel 1;<br>
# Description of the connection<br>
comment "Your GPS Device Here";<br>
}<br>
<br>
Change XX:XX:XX.... to your device ID<br>
<br>
Open Opencpn and write /dev/rfcomm0 as GPS NMEA device. Note that you 
can add it yourself by writing directly into the scroll down box.<br>
Permissions for /dev/rfcomm0 are for group "dialout". Make sure you belong to that group.<br>
The command "groups" will show all the groups you belong to.<br>
Make sure that "gpsd" isn't running, issuing "killall gpsd" as root.<br>
 
<h2 id="MacOSX"><strong>Mac OSX</strong></h2>
<br>
Attaching a GPS device to a Mac is done via one of the USB ports. 
Whether using a device with its own USB lead or via a serial-USB adapter
 lead or an NMEA multiplexer with USB port, the appropriate OS X driver 
needs to be installed. Nearly all hardware uses one of just two chip 
makes: those from FTDI or Prolific. Both those companies make OS X 
drivers available on their web sites, but manufacturers of GPS devices 
usually package the driver with device.<br>
<br>
When the driver is installed and the device connected, start OpenCPN, 
select the Toolbox and click the GPS tab. Open the "NMEA Data Source" 
menu &amp; select the the device from the list. It is not always obvious
 which is the correct one, but in general the device will have a name 
starting: "/dev/cu." or "/dev/tty.". Some manufacturers make it obvious,
 like "/dev/cu.MiniPlex-99000125", but others may be more generic, like:
 "/dev/cu.usbserial". Set the "NMEA Baud Rate" to 4800 and click "OK". 
If the correct selection has been made, you should see the GPS status 
icon change from red to green.

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
It is no wonder that iPads and Android tablets have become so popular. 
They offer superior ergonomics vs. laptops in many settings, including 
areas with limited space and power such as boat cabins and cockpits. 
Tablets usually offer superior battery life, lower power consumption, 
and are easier to waterproof via inexpensive pouches.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately OpenCPN currently cannot install natively in an Android or
 iOS environment. However, there are a couple of ways to get OpenCPN 
running under Linux on Android tablets. See <em><a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/node/193">Building on Motorola Xoom</a> </em>for more information.<br>
<br>
<b>Running OpenCPN on a Windows 8 tablet</b><br>
<br>
Although Windows 8 tablets are not as common as iPads or Android, they 
have the advantage of running on the exact same Windows platform as PCs 
and laptops. This means you can install OpenCPN onto a tablet using the 
 same installer that is used for Windows laptops and desktops. Just 
dowload the installer and appropriate charts, run the installer, and 
select the chart location just like you would on any PC.<br>
<br>
Because of differences in Windows 8 vs. prior Windows versions, and 
configuration differences in the tablet hardware, your user experience 
with OpenCPN on a Windows tablet may be enhanced by considering these 
optional tips and tricks:<br>
<br>
1. Install the <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/">Classic Shell</a> 
free software. This facilitates using the tablet with traditional 
Windows desktop programs, and will make the Win8 environment more 
familiar for those who are coming from XP, Vista, or Win7. You can still
 bring up the Start Screen to use the newer "Metro" tablet apps, but 
Classic Shell restores the familiar Start menu that Windows users are 
accustomed to having.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ClassicShell_zpsbfed952c.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
2. Check Device Manager-Sensors to verify whether your tablet has a GNSS
 Geolocation sensor. If so, your tablet has GPS capabilities already 
built in. (Some tablets have been discovered to have GPS even though the
 specifications may not mention it.)<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/DeviceManager_zpsb0197e16.png"><br>
However, the Windows 8 tablets initially are configured in a way that 
only Metro apps can see the built-in GPS. In order to overcome this 
limitation, try installing petrsimon's excellent <a href="https://bitbucket.org/petrsimon/geolocationtcp/downloads">GeolocationTCP utility</a>.
 Set this utility to launch at bootup so it's always there by putting a 
shortcut in the Startup folder created by Classic Shell.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/GeolocationTCP_zps5cb554ea.png"><br>
<br>
Then you need to configure OpenCPN to receive the <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/nmea.html" title="View more discussions on NMEA">NMEA</a> data over the appropriate TCP port.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Options-Connections_zps80f51d7f.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
3. If you do not have an internal GPS and want one to interface with 
your tablet, I recommend a Bluetooth GPS transmitter instead of a wired 
dongle or puck. There are Android and iPhone apps that will transmit 
from your smartphone, or you can purchase a freestanding Bluetooth GPS 
made by GlobalSat or others. Transmitting GPS to the tablet via 
Bluetooth also facilitates putting the tablet into a waterproof pouch. 
Some have reported that hanging a USB connector off the side of the 
tablet may weaken the microUSB plug over time.<br>
<br>
4. The excellent form factor of the tablet opens up some great 
possibilities for use in the cockpit, if you select a tablet with a 
sufficiently bright screen. A suggested tablet model and more 
comprehensive list of tips can be found on <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/windows-8-tablets-for-opencpn-135663.html" target="_blank">this message thread</a>.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN runs remarkably well on a tablet with practically no 
modifications. Microsoft has emulated many mouse functions in their OS. 
The right-click context menus are emulated by tap-hold. Zooming and 
unzooming in OpenCPN is accomplished by pinching gesture, or using the 
magnifying glass icons in the toolbar.<br>
<br>
Mouse hover (aka "rollover") is not generally supported on tablets, and 
accidentally tapping the chart can lead to unexpected re-centering of 
the chart. To address this and other tablet needs, OpenCPN adds some 
some custom features available in the Options-User Interface menu:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Options-UserInterface_zpsfc3672fb.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Activating "Enable Touchscreen Interface" alters the effect of tapping/clicking on the chart in the following ways:<br>
<br>
-Suppresses re-centering of the chart by tapping (you need to tap-drag to pan the chart)<br>
-Tapping waypoint selects it for subsequent dragging<br>
-Tapping Routes and <a class="#AIS">AIS</a> targets shows popup info<br>
-Tapping tide/current icons shows appropriate dialog<br>
<br>
Here are some additional behaviors with "Enable Touchscreen Interface" activated:<br>
<br>
-Optimize several common dialogs for screen rotation, i.e. landscape or portrait<br>
-Route Create workflow: "Done" by clicking toolbar "Route" icon, or normal context menu.<br>
-Toolbar navigation items (e.g. Zoom/Scale) are available during route creation.<br>
-Chart drag (a.k.a. swipe) is available during route creation.<br>
-Routepoint/Waypoint edit by drag is supported.<br>
-Increase pixel select radius, to allow for finger tip selection of routes/waypoints<br>
<br>
A second option, "Enable Tablet Scaled Graphics Interface" can improve 
the display, especially on tablets with high pixel density. At present, 
Windows tablets are generally lower pixel density than Android and iPad,
 but this may change with future hardware. This option does the 
following:<br>
<br>
-Increase toolbar icon size<br>
-Increase context menu text item size<br>
-Increase selectable item sizes for several common dialogs<br>
<br>
Tablet Scaled Graphics may enlarge the toolbar icons too much for some 
tastes, especially on small tablets with limited screen space. As an 
alternative, Microsoft provides a Magnifier utility that temporarily 
zooms the view and allows for panning across the enlarged screen. It can
 be found in Start-All Programs-Windows Ease of Access (if you have 
Classis Shell installed), or by searching the Start Page in the Modern 
iterface. I recommend pinning a shortcut to the taskbar for quick 
one-tap access. While zooming the OpenCPN menu can enlarge many chart 
features, Magnifier can enlarge additional elements like the very small 
depth soundings and the green-over-black status text displayed by the 
Active Route:<br>
<br>
<img alt="Screenshot of Windows Magnifier utility" src="images/MagnifierZoomB.jpg"><br>

<br>
Following are Dave's comments on "Enable Tablet Scaled Graphics Interface":<br>
- It is important that the screen width dimension be properly set for this option to work.<br>
- Manual override of screen width can be done at <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/setting_options#advanced">Options-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced</a>.<br>
- Dave found, on his W8.1 tablet, that the automatically calculated size
 value was wrong, leading to extra large toolbar icons. Easy to correct 
with a physical measurement.<br>
<br>
In the "Tablet Scaled Graphics Interface", the toolbar icon target minimum size is 9mm square.<br>
This is the generally accepted minimum button size for several mobile platforms.<!-- google_ad_section_end -->  </div>

<br>
In Linux there is an excellent tool, "ddd", the Data Display Debugger, 
to help the developers pinpoint where an error, or bug, is located in 
the source code. "ddd" is a graphical front-end to the text based "gdb",
 the GNU debugger.<br>
<br>
Install ddd through Synaptic, Ubuntu Software Center or similar for other Linux distributions.<br>
From a command line, in a Debian based Linux, such as Ubuntu, issue this command:<br>
$sudo apt-get install ddd
<ul>
	<li>The "$" sign above,  just marks that this is a command line for a 
normal user. Do not include it in the actual command. This is a Linux 
convention used everywhere.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Startddd">Start ddd</h4>
To start ddd, find a command-line and<br>
$ddd opencpn<br>
<br>
ddd starts and this is what you will see.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ddd1.jpg" width="750"><br>
<br>
Click "Run". If you don't get this small dialog, go to Program -&gt; Run, or hit F2<br>
This will start OpenCPN. Just continue in OpenCPN and proceed to create a crash.<br>
Then go back to the ddd window.<br>
This is how it will look like after a crash.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ddd2.jpg" width="750"><br>
<br>
Notice "Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault."<br>

The crash happened at #0 and this very short back trace started at #9.<br>
Your job now is to take a screen-dump, similar to the picture above, and send it on.<br>
Try to get as much of the back trace as possible, by expanding the Back trace dialog.<br>
This is important, so the developers can see the trouble point in the source code.<br>
Look at #3 above, ending in "....chart1.cpp:2367". "chart1.cpp" is a 
part of the OpenCPN source code, and something on line 2367 was 
involved, directly or indirectly in the crash.<br>
Lines ending in "......... .so.0" are external libraries used to run OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
On the odd occasion, when the back trace is very long, the developers may still complain that they need to see more.<br>
 
<h4 id="Usinggdb">Using gdb</h4>
Gdb, the command line debugger, is the answer.<br>
Start like this<br>
$gdb opencpn<br>
Gdb starts and you get the gdb command prompt (gdb).<br>
Just type "r", for run and hit Enter. Like this:<br>
(gdb) r<br>
<br>
OpenCPN will now start, once again, make it crash.<br>
The console will look similar to below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/gdb.jpg" width="750"><br>
All the lines before the "Segmentation fault" line, are just "chatter" 
from PortAudio and Gdk, and are not directly related to OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
To get a back trace, simply<br>
(gdb)bt<br>
That is type "bt", for back trace, and hit enter.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/gdb1.jpg" width="750"><br>
<br>
You will now have access to the full back trace, with more details and reverse order to "ddd".<br>
Copy the text, and send it on.<br>
Press "q" to exit gdb.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->OpenCPN uses some basic settings or limitations.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Courses are by default true, not magnetic.</strong> Change this in Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Units.</li>
	<li><strong>All distances and routes are calculated using Mercator Sailing</strong>. Great Circle Sailing is an option in route creating.</li>
	<li>For Windows: only one instance of OpenCPN is allowed. Use the  portable option if more instances are needed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Do not edit the opencpn.ini (opencpn.conf) file when OpenCPN is running</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Let's take a look at some of OpenCPN's basic features.<!-- google_ad_section_end -->  <div id="node-321" class="section-3">
  <h1 id="TheMenuBar" class="book-heading">The Menu Bar</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The Menu Bar is a good aid to find 
features and shortcuts, and works best if you already is a bit familiar 
with OpenCPN. This page contains links that explains the different 
features.<br>
<br>
The Menu Bar, when visible, is situated just under the Title Bar and 
above the default position of the Tool Bar. See Below. It contains 
access to features, as well as help with available shortcuts, also 
called hot keys.<br>
<br>
The Menu Bar can be activated i two ways.<br>
It can be on all the time by ticking Options-&gt;User Interface -&gt; Show Menu Bar.<br>
If this choice is not on, the Menu Bar can be shown temporarily by using the hot-key <strong>"Alt"</strong>.<br>
As son as the screen is used, for example by panning or double clicking for an Object Query, the Menu Bar disappears.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/MenuBar.png" width="700px"><br>
<br>
As seen above the Menubar consist of five entries.<br>
When a menubar item is visible, the characters shown on the right of the
 items are "hints" to remind user of the shortcut key to use when the 
menu is closed. While the menu is open, this kay may be inactive. The 
key to use is the first character of the item itself. This may be 
platform dependent.<br>
Alt + underlined letter, opens the concerned sub-menu. Alt +N will open 
"Navigate". The exact behavior is platform dependent. For example Alt + A
 will open the Ais menu on Windows. Linux requires Alt and then Alt + A.<br>

  <h1 id="ToolbarButtons" class="book-heading">Toolbar Buttons</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>The Toolbar is floating and can be placed anywhere on the screen, vertical or horizontal.<br>
Note the "grabber" symbol at the far right side of the toolbar. Use this
 handle to drag the toolbar wherever you want it. The default position 
is horizontal and docked top left.<br>
It "snaps" to the edges. Right click on the grabber, and the toolbar 
shifts to vertical format. On Windows (at least), unless in OpenGL 
display mode, the toolbar dims down transparently until you roll over 
it.<br>
<br>
There are three different styles of Toolbars to choose from. Go to the 
ToolBox-&gt;"User interface"-&gt; "Toolbar and Window Style" and select 
one of the following styles:<br>
<br>
Traditional<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33tradtoolbar.png" width="747"><br>
Journeyman<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33jmantoolbar.png"><br>
Journeyman Flat<br>
<img alt="" src="images/3jmanflattoolbar.png"></p>

<p><br>
There are a lot of buttons available in the standard Toolbar, even more,
 counting the many plugins. To control exactly which buttons to display,
 hold the cursor over any button and right-click. This dialog pops up.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/buttons-select.png" height="403" width="450"><br>
<br>
Only the buttons with a ticked box will be displayed. The available 
shortcuts are also shown in parenthesis to the right of the button 
description.<br>
<strong>The MOB button is special</strong>. If unticked, you will get these choices:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/MOB-choice.png" height="178" width="500"><br>
<br>
<strong>#1:</strong> The MOB button will still be there, but anyone (crew?) may later hide it.<br>
<br>
<strong>#2:</strong> If OpenCPN is used to handle a MOB situation, 
choose this option. The MOB button will always be there. It is not 
possible to change the state as long as OpenCPN is running. The MOB 
button option will not even appear in the right-click menu.<br>
To reset this option open the opencpn.ini(config) file and change the value below from<br>
"1" to "0". Restart and all the options are once again available.<br>
"[Settings]<br>
....<br>
PermanentMOBIcon=1"<br>
<br>
<strong>#3: </strong>Use this option if a MOB situation is handled by 
other means, and OpenCPN is not a part of the standard operational MOB 
procedure.<br>
<br>
<strong>If the MOB button is visible, it will always be the button 
furthest to the right. This way it's always easy to find in bad light 
etc.</strong><br>
<br>
The visibility of the plugin buttons is controlled in the ToolBox-&gt;Plugins Tab, by pressing the Enable/Disable toggle button.<br>
<br>
Note that the Toolbar must have at least one active button.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/last-button.png" height="119" width="400"><br>
<br>
<br>
When a toggle button is pressed, it changes and becomes darker, 
Traditional style also adds a stronger outer frame. For example, 
tracking off <img alt="" src="images/track_off.png" align="absMiddle" height="41" width="40">, tracking  on <img alt="" src="images/track-pressed.png" align="absMiddle" height="43" width="42">.<br>
<br>
A brief explanation of the use of each button is available by just hovering with the cursor<br>
<br>
over a button. <img alt="" src="images/explain.png" align="absMiddle" height="53" width="163"><br>

  <h1 id="RightClickMenu" class="book-heading">Right Click Menu</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The right click menu is always available as long as the cursor is somewhere in the chart area. <strong>The content of this menu is very context sensitive.</strong>
 The reason for the  "Focused Context Menus", is to keep the number of 
options down to a reasonable level, and still be able to deal with all 
situations.<br>
There are basic right-click menus when clicking at a random point, and 
very focused menus when clicking on a waypoint, a route, a track or an 
AIS target. If you have just created or deleted a waypoint, or if chart 
groups are defined, there are further entries added to the basic menu. 
Some plugins also adds entries to the right-click menu when they are 
used. Below, the basic entries are explained.The more context specific 
entries are dealt with as the concerned feature is explained. <br>
 
<h3 id="The basic single charts right-click menus.">The basic single charts right-click menus.</h3>
Below is first the rastercharts menu to the left and then the vector chart menu.<br>
Available "hotkeys", if any, are shown to the right.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/base_raster_single.png" align="top" height="302" hspace="5" width="251"><img alt="" src="images/base_vectot_single1.png" height="273" hspace="10" width="282"><br>
<br>
Starting with the left menu for rastercharts.
<h5 id="Measure">Measure</h5>
Activates a "pencil". Move the pencil with the cursor. Put the tip of 
the pencil on a position that you want to measure from. Left-click, a 
dot Position with a circle around is created. Move the pencil with the 
mouse and see the distance and bearing from the point to the pencil-tip 
in "real time". Left-clicking again creates a temporary waypoint. When 
moving the "pencil" again, distance and bearing, once again are shown 
from the temporary waypoint. The total distance from the original 
measure point, via the temporary wapoint(s) are also shown as "Route 
Distance". Right click and mark "Measure Off" to stop measuring.<br>
For longer distances, specially on east.west courses on higher 
latitudes, the measure tool seamlessly switches to display and measure 
great circles instead of Mercator rhumb-lines. Read more <a href="#Great-circleSailing"><em>Great-circle Sailing</em></a> .<br>
The  "Create Route" tool works in a similar way, but you can't use the two tools at the same time.

More about routes:<a href="#MarksandRoutes"> <em>Marks and Routes</em></a><br>
<br>
<strong>Center View...</strong><br>
Activates a small dialog where latitude and longitude can be entered. 
Pressing "OK" centers the display on this position, keeping the same 
scale. If a position has been copied, and is in your copy buffer, it 
will be displayed as default values. OpenCPN accepts a wide variety of 
position formats. The values entered is kept during a session, but goes 
when restarting OpenCPN.<br>
 
<h5 id="CourseUpMode">Course Up Mode</h5>
Is shown because we are in North Up Mode. Clicking this entry changes 
the display to "North Up  Mode." It is a toggle switch between "North 
Up" and "Course Up". Read more about display orientation: <a href="#AutoFollowandDisplayOrientation"><em>Auto Follow and Display Orientation</em></a><br>
<br>
<strong>AIS Target List</strong><br>
Shows a list of discovered AIS targets, if any. Read more on the <a href="#AIS"><em>AIS</em></a><em> </em> page.<br>
<br>
Looking at the right click menu for vector charts, to the right above,we can see these additional entries.<br>
 
<h5 id="ObjectQuery">Object Query</h5>
Every point on a vector-chart has certain attributes, or information. 
This can vary from just the depth in mid ocean to much more. Double 
clicking is an alternative to display the object query dialog. Here is 
an example from a lateral buoy in the entrance channel to a medium sized
 port.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/objq.png" height="489" width="441"><br>
<br>
 The scrollbar on the right side of the dialog, reveals that more info 
is available by scrolling down. Much more about this on the <a href="#VectorCharts"><em>Vector Charts</em></a> page.<br>

  <h1 id="Zooming" class="book-heading">Zooming</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>It is essential to understand what 
happens when both zooming in and zooming out in a chart view. Vector 
charts have their own issues, with both over- and under- zooming. Both 
can be potentially dangerous, and it's essential to understand what's 
going on.</p>

<h4 id="How too Zoom in/out">How too Zoom in/out</h4>
Zooming in makes the chart scale larger while zooming out makes the scale smaller

<p><img alt="" src="images/zoomin.png" height="32" width="32"> <img alt="" src="images/zoomout.png" height="32" width="32"> These buttons allow you to zoom in and out on the chart currently being displayed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/zoomin.png" height="32" width="32"> Will zoom the chart in for more detail, larger scale.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" src="images/zoomout.png" height="32" width="32"> </strong>Will zoom the chart view out for more area, smaller scale.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Alternatively, the + and - keys on your keyboard will zoom in and 
out.  If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, it can also be used to 
quickly zoom in and out.<br>
<br>
Other alternatives for zooming includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Page Up for zooming in.</li>
	<li>Page Down for zooming</li>
	<li>Menu Bar-&gt;Navigate click Zoom In / Zoom Out</li>
</ul>
For zooming in smaller steps try

<ul>
	<li>Alt + for fine scale zooming in.</li>
	<li>Alt - for fine scale zooming out.</li>
	<li>Alt + scroll wheel, zooming in/out in small steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some settings for zooming are available in the Options -&gt; 
Display-&gt;General tab. Read more about "Smooth Panning/Zooming" and 
"Zoom to Cursor" in <em><a href="#SettingOptions">Setting Options</a></em> .<br>
<br>
Note that</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keyboard, Menubar, and Toolbar zooms always zoom to the center of the screen.</li>
	<li>Wheel zoom behaviour changes depending on "Zoom To Cursor" and "SmoothZoom" settings.</li>

<img alt="" src="images/rasteroverz.jpg" height="455" width="600"><em>Overzooming a raster chart.</em><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/vecoverz.jpg" height="455" width="600"><br>
<em>Overzooming a vector chart.</em><br>
<br>
If you zoom in enough there will appear a warning <strong>"OverZoom"</strong> in the upper left part of the chart area.<br>
This means that you have zoomed in way to far, and is using the chart at
 a scale that was never intended, and that is not supported by the 
original survey. <strong>No new information will be seen, and the situation is potentially dangerous </strong>as it could give the impression of  increased distance between dangers.<br>
On a raster-chart pixelation will be seen, but on a vector chart it is 
not so obvious when you have over zoomed. This is where the warning is 
useful.<br>
Your first action when the warning appears should be to zoom out at least one snap.<br>
Charts are generally based on surveys in twice the scale of the released
 chart, so when zooming in beyond a factor of 2, there is no support, 
increased details etc, in the underlying survey. OpenCPN warns for 
"OverZoom" when zooming with a factor of 4 or more.
<h4 id=""> </h4>

<p><strong>Overzooming settings</strong>  are explained in <em><a href="#SettingOptions">Setting Options</a></em>
 . In short OpenCPN, by default, blurs  vector-charts and expands the 
text an lines, to imitate what happens with raster charts, when zooming 
in beyond a factor 10.0 x .<br>
<br>
<strong>Unlimited zooming</strong> is available using the background Map. Just create an empty chartgroup and switch to this map at any time. More in <em><a href="#ChartGroups">Chart Groups</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="Underzooming"><br>
Underzooming</h2>
<br>
Underzooming is only a general problem with CM93 V2, in OpenCPN. The 
reason is the very poor graphical representation in small scale charts, 
of reefs,small islands and other dangers.<br>
The case with the Cargados Carajos Shoals in Indian Ocean is well known 
since Team Vestas grounding in the 2014/2015 Volvo Ocean Race.<br>
<br>
This is what you see. All pictures are in a scale of approximately 1:650.000.<br>
The "normal view. No indication at all of islands or reefs, even though 
the name in it self  indicates, to a seasoned navigator, that more 
information should be sought elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/OZ.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Switching to single mode view, and with chart outlines active, OpenCPN 
shows that a larger scale chart is available. This will show on zooming 
in further. The available chart does not cover the southern end of the 
reef where Vestas ran aground. In some editions of CM93 more charts of 
the area are available, including the southern part.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/OZ1.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Compare this to the well thought out representation in the raster chart INT 702 in scale 1:3.500.000.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/OZ2-INT702.jpg" width="500&quot;"><br>
 
<h4 id="Using CM93 in OpenCPN">Using CM93 in OpenCPN</h4>
It all starts with passage planning. The bottom line is: Don't trust 
CM93. Always check with other reliable sources, meaning, for example, 
Raster charts (paper charts) Pilot Books, or ENC charts, <strong>not </strong>another privately issued vector chart, with similar problems ( for example Navionics).<br>
<br>
<strong>Doing the best you can with OpenCPN and only CM93 available.</strong><br>
For passages including small scale CM93 charts (A or Z scale):<br>
Create a route that you plan to follow.<br>
Switch to Single chart mode. Short Key "Q".<br>
Avtivate chart outlines.Short Key "O".<br>
"Fly" along the route, making sure you are zoomed in to a factor of at least 2.5 x.<br>
Available charts should now be outlined in magenta.<br>
Drop suitable marks documenting these charts, and the dangers they represent, for later reference.<br>

<div><em>Brazilian charts - a free download.</em></div>
<br>
<strong>OpenCPN </strong>does<strong> </strong>not come with any pre-installed charts<strong>. </strong>It is up to the user to find and install charts<strong>. </strong>Read
 on, and you will find detailed information about which chart formats 
that OpenCPN can display, as well as pointers to all available charts 
for OpenCPN, free downloads as well as commercial, that we know of.<br>
<br>
<strong>Background Chart</strong>. OpenCPN comes with a worldwide background map, displayed if no charts are available for an area.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/BGchart.jpg" height="568" width="750"><br>
<br>
To install charts, OpenCPN must be pointed to a directory containing Charts of one of the recognized  <a href="#ChartFormats"><em><strong>Chart Formats</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> Don't point OpenCPN to individual charts. You must specify the directory that contains the charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where do I keep my charts ?</strong><br>
The installation tells you to go to the Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Chart Files tab to install charts.<br>
When you press the "Add Directory" button the default directory will be 
"My Documents" for Windows, and the users home directory, for Linux and 
Mac. These are good places to keep your charts. Create a "Chart" 
directory, and maybe some sub directories, to keep your charts in, and 
you can't go far wrong.<br>
Seasoned users knows where they want their charts.<br>
Regard charts as data, independent of OpenCPN. Store them in a place 
that is convenient for you and that is left alone by the operating 
system.<br>
Download some charts (see <a href="#ChartSources"><em>Chart Sources</em></a>) to your newly created Chart directory. Follow the directions below to make this directory an "Active Chart Directory"<br>
<br>
The main consideration for charts is  storing them in a directory where they will not be tampered with or moved accidentally.<br>
<br>
<strong>Installing Charts</strong><br>
Open the Options Dialog by clicking <img alt="" src="images/settings_003.png" height="32" width="32">.  You are sent to the first tab "Display". Tick the box "Show Chart Outlines". That will help you visualize the loaded charts.<br>
 <br>
<img alt="" src="images/4Start-Charts.png"><br>
<br>
Then click the tab "Charts" and then the tab "Chart Files".<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4Start-Charts1.png"><br>
<br>
There are no charts loaded. To add charts we have to add a directory 
that contains charts of a recognized format. To get started press "Add 
Directories" and navigate to your chart-directory. <br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4Start-Charts2.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Exactly how the dialog looks like depends on your operating system, and is not a part of the core OpenCPN.<br>
When clicking the button "Open" above,  the highlighted chart directory 
is added to  the  box "Directories". The screen-shots are from Linux, 
but this process works similarly on all platforms. Add more chart 
directories using the same process again. It's OK to load both raster- 
and vector-charts together.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4Start-Charts3.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
All that remains is to click the "Apply" button. OpenCPN will then 
process your selection. You can now start using your charts. When you 
are done with your settings click "OK" and the Options Dialog closes. If
 you are just adding a chart directory, it works fine to just click the 
"Ok" button.<br>
<br>
The charts often come in a compressed package eg. a ZIP archive. You 
must first uncompress them to your disk to be able to set them up. The 
following screenshot shows the file and directory structure of the NOAA 
raster charts (RNC) on a local disk<br>
<br>
<img alt="NOAA RNC Charts directory structure" src="images/us_rnc_charts_structure.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
<strong><u>Note that in OpenCPN you must add directories (folders) containing charts, not the individual charts.</u></strong><br>
<br>
For <strong>BSB4</strong> and <strong>nv-charts</strong>, first install the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/downloadplugins">latest plugin version</a>, then point OpenCPN to the correct chart directories and finally do a "Full Database Rebuild".<br>
<br>
<strong>Eager to get some charts quickly, to get started?</strong> Go to:  <a href="#ChartSources"><em>Chart Sources</em></a><br>
 
<h3 id="Checkyourchartsafterinstallation">Check your charts after installation</h3>
This step is important if you just installed some old BSB charts, say 
from the ninties, or charts of dubious origin. For example, there are a 
lot of old Maptech charts that uses the Geodetic Datum "Unknown".<br>
It is not a problem with recent charts.<br>
OpenCPN Version 4.0 will reject charts <strong>without a projection</strong> and add a note in the log about the problem.<br>
Charts with an unrecognized Geodetic Chart Datum will be loaded as if 
they were WGS84. This may lead to unacceptable errors. The Chart 
Information Dialog will contain the sentence:<strong>"Warning: Chart Datum may be incorrect."</strong> , and the log will contain a note with the words "Chart datum {XXXX} invalid on chart".<br>
For practical use, it's very important that the implication of this is understood.<br>
Read up on the subject in the <em> <a href="#ChartInfo">Chart Info</a> </em>page<br>
<br>
<strong>Start using your charts</strong>.<br>
You can click and drag the chart with your mouse. The cursor changes to 
an triangular green arrow near the edges of the OpenCPN window, left 
clicking in this situation, pans the chart in the direction of the 
arrow. The scroll wheel zooms in and out. Left clicking anywhere centers
 the view on that position. Right clicking brings up a menu with useful 
actions. Exactly what the menu contains depends on the circumstances. 
Read the rest of the manual for a full explanation.<br>
<br>
If you are running OpenCPN for the first time you may see the background
 chart instead of the charts you installed.  That simply means OpenCPN 
is pointed at a location that is not on any of the charts you installed.
  Click and drag, or use the arrow keys, to move the view-point to the  
location of one of your installed charts as described under "<strong>A few hints</strong>"
 below. Look for the rectangular outlines of the installed charts. An 
alternative is to right-click, and then click "Jump to position". Enter a
 location that is within the perimeters of your entered charts. The 
first time you start OpenCPN the view will be centered on Georgetown in 
South Carolina.<br>
<br>
<strong>Quilting Chart Mode</strong> is the default display mode. In 
this mode all available charts at the viewpoint will be quilted together
 seamlessly according to certain roles. Read more in <a href="#ChartQuilting"><em>Chart Quilting</em></a><em>.</em> The other display mode is <strong>Single chart Mode</strong>
 were only one chart at a time is used. It is possible to read all the 
information printed in the perimeter of a raster chart. To change to 
another chart, select and click in the Chart Selection Bar. Read more in
 <a href="#StatusBar"><em>Status Bar</em></a>.<br>
 
<div><strong>Starting with vector charts?</strong></div>
If you are new to vector charts, including CM93 v2, on OpenCPN follow this quick-start guide:<br>
<br>
1 Go to Options <img alt="" src="images/settings_002.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">-&gt;Charts-&gt; Vector Chart Display and copy the settings below for the Display Category.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/4Start-Charts4.png"></div>
<br>
2 Press this button <img alt="" src="images/text.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> in the ToolBar to toggle text display. Alternatively, the "T" hotkey does the same thing.<br>
<br>
These are not the "perfect" settings, but you will see most of what you expect from a vector chart.<br>
As soon as you have made yourself reasonably comfortable with OpenCPN 
and before using Vector Charts for actual navigation, make sure you 
understand all the settings in the Options-&gt; Charts -&gt; Vector 
Chart Display Tab by reading the <a href="#VectorCharts"><em>Vector Charts</em></a> page.<br>
<strong>Loading Vector Charts</strong><br>
When using a vector chart for the first time, OpenCPN has to process the
 data, and transform the information to an internal display format. 
Click the green chart rectangle in the chart-bar to start the process.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33vec.png"><br>
This can take some time, depending on your computer. This internal SENC 
chart, is saved for future use. The created files are quite large, but 
is in a format optimized for quick loading. OpenCPN is trading, creation
 time and size, for fast rendering when actually using the vector chart.
 The SENC files are saved in the SENC directory, in the same place as 
the opencpn.conf file - opencpn.ini on windows.<br>
To avoid getting a very long series of SENC charts being built at the 
same time, use single chart mode, for better control. This is certainly 
called for in areas that are densely populated with vector charts. 
Single chart mode and quilting are explained on this page <em><a href="#ChartQuilting">Chart Quilting</a></em> .<br>
You probably do not want to build SENCs for all of your loaded S57 ENCs unless you plan to actually go there....<br>
For an advanced approach to building all SENC files in one go .. <em><a href="#TheCommandLine">The Command Line</a></em><br>
<strong>Updating Vector Charts</strong><br>
Publishers of Vector Charts, such as NOAA and EAHC issues regular 
updates. OpenCPN updates the created SENCs automatically. The chart 
itself, the base-chart, is named "name".000 , the first update is 
"name".001 and so on. As a user you only have to make sure that the 
update files are saved in the same place as the base-chart. In the case 
of a new edition of the chart a new "name".000 file is issued. Just 
replace the old file with the new file and OpenCPN will update the SENC 
file. Don't forget to remove the updates to the old edition of the 
chart.<br>
<br>
In case of missing revisions in a series of updates errors may be 
introduced. OpenCPN will pop up a warning dialog with this content:<br>
 
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	
		<tbody><tr>
			<td><span class="pl-s1"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>S57 Cell Update chain incomplete.<br>

<strong>CM93 Charts</strong><br>
CM93-version2 Charts are different from the S57 vector charts, and has 
it's own data structure consisting of a number of folders and files. To 
load these charts in OpenCPN just add the top directory to the list of 
"Active Chart Directories".<br>
In the top CM93 directory is an empty file with the ".EXD", for example 
20110803.EXD. The format is YYYYMMDD.EXD. This is the version, or 
edition, of the CM93 -v2 release.<br>
OpenCPN supports partial CM93 datasets, covering one or a few of the 
available regions. There is also support for multiple, as well as 
multiple partial, CM93 datasets.<br>
The CM93 top directory contains a number of (144) subdirectories named from<br>
"00300000" to "04501020", as well as six other files. These sub 
directories each cover a geographical area of 40° x 40° . The first four
 numbers describes the latitude and the last four, the longitude of the 
SW corner of the area covered.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/CM-top.jpg"><br>
<em>This is a typical content of the CM93 V2 top directory</em>.<br>
<br>
The key to understanding the numbers is to realize that CM93's coordinate system<br>
of the world starts at the South Pole or to be exact at lat -90° long 0° and from there<br>
proceeds North a East with a factor of 3 for each degree of lat and long.<br>
The tile 00300000 hence has the SW corner at lat from -90° + 0030:3 = -80° or 80°S to<br>
and longitude  0°E , and covers the area from 80°S latitude to 40°S and from 0° longitude to 40°E.<br>
Looking at 04501020 it brakes down to lat -90° + 0450:3 = 60° and long 
1020:3 = 340° subtracting 360° results in -20° or 20°W. So we have he SW
 corner at 60°N and 20°W .<br>
One more example, the tle 03900840 has the SW corner at 40°N and 80°W.<br>
<br>
Each of these sub-directories in turn contains directories with the 
individual charts. Ordered in scale from smallest to largest they are 
Z,A,B,C,D,E,F and G. Where Z contains  overview charts and G contains 
harbor plans. Note that, generally, not all of these are present in each
 subdirectory.<br>
<br>
Z covers 40° x 40° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3.000.000 scale<br>
A covers 20° x 20° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:1.000.000 scale<br>
B covers 10° x 10° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:200.000 scale<br>
down to<br>
..<br>
G covers 20' x 20' and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3500 scale.<br>
The individual chart tiles in these directories have the same logic in the naming scheme as described above.<br>
<br>
<strong>A few hints. </strong>

<ul>
	<li>If you ticked the "Show Chart Outlines" box under the "Display" tab
 the loaded charts will be outlined in red for raster and green for 
vector charts. In CM93 the charts will be outlined in purple, but only 
in Single Chart Mode. The smallest scale charts in CM93, the Z scale and
 A scale charts, will not be outlined. Neither will all available charts
 be visible as outlines at the same time. The reason for this is 
computing speed and clarity. Generally the next level or two of larger 
scale charts are shown. When large scale plans are available directly 
from A scale charts, with no intermediate charts, the outline of the 
larger scale charts will be visible from a zoom level between 1.5 and 
2.0, but only, as already mentioned, in single chart mode and with chart
 outlines switched on. <strong>Generally in areas where only A or Z scale charts are available, expect potentially dangerous omissions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Warning, do not use CM93 small scale charts alone for navigation without referring to other sources.</strong><br>
 
<ul>
	<li>Be aware that it is possible to "Over-zoom" charts in OpenCPN. A 
warning will appear on the display. Please respect that warning. It is 
recommended to not zoom more than a factor 2, for safe navigation. The 
actual zoom-factor appears in the lower right-hand corner of the 
display.</li>
	<li>It is safe and reasonably efficient, to put all your charts <strong>except </strong>the
 CM93 database in one large directory, and set that directory in 
Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Chart Files. The CM93 database contains its own 
file and directory structure. The top-level directory only, of this 
database, should be loaded, as described above.<br>
	If you do a lot of chart downloads, updates, etc., then it will be 
faster to break the charts folder into smaller groups, and specify them 
individually in the Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Chart Files dialog. Consider 
using <a href="#ChartGroups"><em>Chart Groups</em></a></li>
	<li>"<strong>Scan Charts and Update Database </strong>" Use this option
 if you have made any changes to the contents of your chart directories,
 as for example after downloading new charts from NOAA, etc. It need not
 be checked if directories are added or subtracted, as the entire 
database will be scanned and updated automatically in this case.</li>
	<li>"<strong>Force Full Database Rebuild</strong>" is mainly aimed at 
users converting or correcting existing charts, in a situation where 
changes are made to the geo-referencing, outline of the chart, or other 
attributes in the kap file header section.</li>
	<li>OpenCPN,  supports  <strong>Mercator Charts, Transverse Mercator Charts, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Charts and Polyconical Charts</strong>
 (used in parts of US and Canada). Charts using other projections will 
not be displayed. A note about the reason for the display refusal, will 
be found in the "opencpn.log". <br>
	"Other" projections could be <strong>Lamberts Conformal Conic Projection</strong>, mainly used in high latitude polar areas.<strong> </strong><strong>Gnomonic</strong>
 charts, mainly used in older, larger scale BA charts, for smaller 
areas, for example harbor plans, in scales larger than 1:50,000. Newer 
editions of these charts are generally re-issued as Transverse Mercator 
charts. Gnomonic projection charts are also traditionally used for Great
 Circle Sailings. Such charts are not needed in OpenCPN, as 
Great-circles are handled internally. <br>
	 </li>
	<li>OpenCPN is <strong>not</strong> suited for Polar Navigation N/S of 
about 70 degrees. As long as there are Mercator charts available, 
OpenCPN is OK though. There are some charts available up to 80 N, for 
example Norwegian chart for the Northern part of Svalbard. The Mercator 
projection is not generally  suited for polar areas, with quickly 
converging meridians.  Small scale (less than 1:100,000 ) high latitude<strong> Transverse Mercator Charts</strong>,
 with clearly converging meridians, cannot be displayed correctly. Other
 projections suited for polar areas can't be displayed at all in 
OpenCPN.</li>
</ul>
<strong>A Linux/Unix Note</strong><br>
These operating systems have a <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html">problem</a> handling chart names containing spaces and non ASCII characters. A typical example is Swedish chart names.<br>
To sort this out use the utility program <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/detox">"detox</a>".
 Detox changes the file names so space becomes "_"; "(" and ")" become 
"-"; and "å","ä" and "ö" become "a","a" and "o", etc. To see what 
"detox" suggests to do, try a dry run first, like this:<br>

<div id="node-37" class="section-4">
  <h1 id="StatusBar" class="book-heading">Status Bar</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>At the bottom of the display, is the Status Bar, activated from "Options-&gt;User Interface-&gt;Show Status Bar".<br>
Just above the Status Bar is the 'Chart Selection Bar'. CTRL +B toggles this bar on/off.<br>
It shows all the available chart for the present view, represented by 
one colored segment for each chart. The order between the segments 
represents the scale of the charts. Largest scale to the left, smallest 
to the right. If CM93 is available, it is always furthest to the right.<br>
The segmented color bars in the Status Bar represent:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Blue for Raster</li>
	<li>Green For ENC's</li>
	<li>Brown/Yellow for CM93 charts</li>
	<li>The current chart displays as a lighter shade of its color, or if 
quilting is active, the charts currently making up the quilt are 
displayed in lighter shade.</li>
	<li>The Chart bar below consisting of 12 segments shows a quilt of two 
active charts. Five charts in the quilt are hidden, due to small scale. 
CM93 is in it's place, to the right. Four charts of larger scale than 
the present view are available. The largest scale chart is a Transverse 
Mercator chart.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="images/seg.png" height="97" width="700"></p>

<h3 id="Limitation">Limitation</h3>
The Chart Bar handles a maximum of 100 charts. The largest scale charts 
will be dropped first if more than 100 chart are available on a 
position. It is unlikely that this will be much of a limitation, but the
 possibility certainly exists if a lot of info charts, pilot charts and 
weather charts etc, are loaded. The symptom will be that large scale 
charts becomes impossible to display.

<p><br>
When you hover the mouse pointer over the bar, and not in quilting mode, a thumbnail of the chart will appear under the <a href="#ScalingCharts"><em>Scaling Charts</em> </a>icons
 and a chart information box will pop up just above the button. If 
quilting is on, instead of a thumbnail, the chart represented by the 
button will be highlighted in a transparent reddish color. By clicking 
on the appropriate bar, or using the appropriate <a href="http://opencpn.org/hot_keys_and_shortcuts"><em>Hot Keys and Shortcuts</em></a>,
 you will switch to the chart shown in the thumbnail. This feature is 
especially useful if you wish to view an ENC or a Raster chart of the 
same area.</p>

<p>The bottom line starting from the left, a bar, that imitates a paddle
 wheel, if a gps position is received, and the gps position. Then 
follows SOG, COG, the position of the cursor, and course and distance 
from the gps position to the cursor. To the far right there is true 
Scale of the display and the Zoom Factor. If the Zoom Factor is missing,
 the chart quilting feature is activated. The Zoom factor is the Scale 
(as above) divided with the natural scale of the chart.<br>
<br>
The buttons, or colored segments, are displaying a lot more information however.<br>
 </p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/tmerc.png" height="30" width="130">   These buttons shows that the two charts are <strong>Transverse Mercator</strong>, and that single char mode is used as the corners of the segments are not rounded.<br>

    The raster chart represented by this button don't participate in the
 quilt because it is hidden by other, larger scale charts. Vector charts
 are represented similar.<br>
<br>
To illustrate a lot of this, here is a screen shot in quilting mode.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Quilt1.jpg"><br>
<br>
<em>The screen is a quilt of two Polyconical charts. Hovering the mouse 
pointer over the left chart-button highlights the lager scale chart for 
Manitowoc. Two smaller scale charts that cover the area displayed on the
 screen are included in the quilt, but are invisible as they are covered
 by the larger scale charts. To view these charts, right-click anywhere 
on a chart in the quilt and select "Remove this chart from quilt", one 
of these charts will now be shown in the quilt.<br>
The Brown right most button shows that CM93 version 2, charts are available for the area, but not currently displayed.<br>
The information box shows relevant information about the chart. We can 
see that the chart is  Polyconic, and because of this a warning is 
displayed for poor accuracy. The reason is, that although Polyconic 
charts are allowed to participate in quilting, the result is not totally
 free from errors, however small.</em><br>

<br>
<strong>ChartFile:</strong> The file on the local computer where the chart is.<br>
<br>
<strong>Name:</strong> The Name of the Chart. Not all vector charts have names, while raster charts always have names.<br>
<br>
<strong>Scale:</strong> The scale of the chart.<br>
<br>
<strong>ID:</strong> The chart number. For raster charts this is the 
same as the number of the paper chart. Vector chart cells have their own
 numbering scheme.<br>
<br>
<strong>Depth Units:</strong> For raster charts this is the units for 
the printed soundings. For vector charts this is the sounding units set 
in Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Units -&gt; Depth.<br>
<br>
<strong>Soundings:</strong> The datum for soundings. It is the level 
that all printed depth figures refers to. Consult a text book on 
Navigation for details.<br>
<br>
<strong>Datum:</strong> The geodetic datum. This will be WGS 84 for all new charts, compiled later than about 1993.<br>
If this value is missing, unknown to OpenCPN, or stated as "UNKNOWN" or 
similar, OpenCPN will not load the chart. The fact will be logged in the
 logfile.<br>
See below for an example of this kind of chart.<br>
<br>
<strong>If the chart is not using WGS 84, but a named, recognized datum, OpenCPN will automatically add necessary corrections.</strong><br>

There is no quick fix for a bad chart, but try to switch to another 
chart if using single mode chart display. If quilting is on, right-click
 on the chart button in the chart-bar and select "Hide this chart".  
Both suggestions assumes that the bad chart can be replaced by other 
charts, which of course isn't always possible.<br>
The chart will probably be OK for navigation with traditional methods. 
Use bearings, vertical or horizontal sextant angles of conspicuous 
landmarks to confirm your position, as well as soundings or any other 
available resources.<br>
 
<h4 id="Checkingachartforaccuracy">Checking a chart for accuracy</h4>
A raster chart, using a named, recognized, Geodetic Datum, for example 
WGS 84, can be checked for the accuracy of the chart grid. This does not
 necessarily guarantee the position of the individual features on the 
chart. Refer to Calders book.<br>
Activate Options -&gt; Display -&gt;General -&gt; Show Grid. A Latitude 
and Longitude grid will be displayed as a layer on top of the chart. 
This grid is OpenCPNs view of how a proper WGS 84 should look like. For 
raster charts this grid can be compared to the "printed" grid on the 
chart picture. Chart errors are to complicated to be treated in a few 
sentences. Refer to Nigel Calders book "How to Read a Nautical Chart" 
for an in depth but still easy to read text.<br>
For a quick check, we are happy with a grid error that is in the region 
of 1 mm at the chart scale. For a chart in 1:50.000 this means an error 
of 50 m.<br>
<br>
Use OpenCPNs ability to grossly over-zoom a chart. Home in on a printed 
lat/long crossing. Below is a test on a commercial BSB3 chart in 
1:60.000. The width of the printed grid - thick black lines - is about 
12 m.  The thin gray lines is OpenCPNs grid layer. The accuracy of this 
chart is very good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Accuracy_12m.png"><br>
<br>
Another example. This time we are looking at a chart in 1:10.000. Very accurate.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Accuracy_10K.png"><br>
 
<h3 id="No Projection -&gt; Chart rejected.">No Projection -&gt; Chart rejected.</h3>
If the chart does not contain any information about the projection, 
OpenCPN don't know how to display them. From Version 4.0, such a char 
will not be loaded, but a note about the problem will appear in the log 
file.<br>
Missing a chart? Check your OpenCPN logfile.<br>
 
<h3 id="No Datum -&gt; ---&lt;&lt;&lt; Warning:  Chart Datum may be incorrect. &gt;&gt;&gt;---">No Datum -&gt; ---&lt;&lt;&lt; Warning:  Chart Datum may be incorrect. &gt;&gt;&gt;---</h3>
The message will be in the Chart Info Box.<br>
This is a warning that the chart probably is not accurate enough for GPS
 navigation. It still should be OK with traditional methods. A minimum 
recommendation is to check the GPS position with traditional methods, a 
couple of compass bearings, for example.<br>
<br>
One example, that unfortunately have lead to problems for a few yachts, 
is DMA/NGA chart 28201, Puerto Morelos, in Mexico, from 1995. This 
chart, based on a Mexican survey from 1905, has a Datum Note, similar to
 this:<br>

<strong>Limitation</strong><br>
Mercator charts, Transverse Mercator charts and Polyconic chart are 
quilted separately and don't mix. The transition from one form of 
quilting to the other is seamless. The background world chart can appear
 in Tmerc and Polyconic quilt in areas where there is no other chart 
coverage.<br>
By quilting, any information available in the white border around a chart, will be hidden.<br>
To see this information hit "Q" to get into single mode display.<br>
Skewed charts don't quilt, unless the skew is less than 5°.<br>
<br>
<strong>Quick Start</strong><br>
Go to Options -&gt; Display -&gt;General -&gt; Enable Chart Quilting. 
Tick he box. Another, simoler way is to use the "Q" short key to toggle 
quilting on/off. Zooming in, automatically brings up larger scale 
charts, if available. Panning reveals a continuous quilt of the 
available charts. If you started with a raster chart, only 
raster-charts, and perhaps CM93, will be in the quilt. The same logic 
applies to S57 and S63 Vector Charts (ENCS). Make sure you are familiar 
with the <a href="#StatusBar"><em>Status Bar</em></a> as this will 
help you interpret all available information. The quilt, like a single

<h3 id="Displayingcharts"><br>
Displaying charts</h3>
OpenCPN has two modes of displaying charts, single chart mode and 
quilting mode. Quilting is the default, and is on in a new installation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Single Chart Mode</strong> only shows one chart at a time, and a
 switch to other charts  must be done by clicking another chart in the 
Chart Bar. All printed general chart information, outside the chart 
proper, can easily be read.<br>
<br>
<strong>To activate</strong> <strong>chart quilting </strong>go to 
Options -&gt; Display-&gt;General  and tick the box "Enable Chart 
Quilting", or use the shortkey "Q" to toggle quilting. Tick the box 
"Show Chart Outlines" at the same time as this will help you see which 
chart mode is active. For CM93 the outline of individual charts can bee 
seen only if quilting is disabled.<br>
<br>
<strong>Full Screen Quilting</strong>. Options -&gt; Display -&gt; "Disable Fullscreen Quilting". <font color="#000000"><span>By
 default all visible charts of an appropriate scale are used in the 
quilt. With this box checked only charts that overlap the center of the 
screen are used in the quilt. Checking this box is easier on the system 
and may give a performance boost in certain circumstances.</span></font><br>
<br>
<strong>Is Chart quilting on?</strong><br>
There are some visual indications on screen to confirm if quilting is on or off.
<ul>
	<li>If the right click menu contains the entry "Hide This Chart", 
quilting is on. Clicking the entry excludes the chart from the quilt.</li>
	<li>The colored rectangles in the status bar have rounded corners and 
the white borders of the charts are invisible when quilting is on. When 
quilting is off in ToolBox-&gt;Settings, the colored rectangles have 
"square" corners.</li>
	<li>If you have the status bar visible at he bottom of the screen, a 
value in brackets after the scale, to the far right, is only shown in 
single mode. The value within the brackets is the zoom factor.</li>
	<li>When hovering with the mouse pointer over a inactive raster chart 
button in single chart mode, a thumbnail of the chart is displayed in 
the upper left corner of the screen. At the same time an information box
 pops up above the button with details about the chart.  This changes 
with quilting, as the thumbnails are replaced with a transparent reddish
 high-lighting of the charts that is a part of the present quilt or has a
 larger scale than the reference chart in the quilt. This means that if 
Mercator charts are quilted the Transverse Mercator Charts will not be 
highlighted, and vice versa.</li>
	<li>The exception to the last rule is CM93 charts. When an area is only
 covered by CM93 charts, indicated by a long yellow chart button in the 
status bar, and in quilting mode, no info-box is displayed and no 
reddish highlighting is taking place.</li>
	<li>When CM93 quilting is off, the outline of the individual cells are outlined in magenta.</li>
</ul>
<br>
More than one chart can be displayed and active at the same time, on the
 picture above, for example there are two pale blue buttons, as there 
are two raster-charts in this quilt. In single mode only one chart 
button is highlighted at a time.<br>
<br>
Depth units that is normally shown in the upper right corner of the 
display, if activated in the toolbox, is only displayed in quilting mode
 if all participating charts  uses the same unit.<br>
Zoom level, normally displayed on the far right on the Status bar, is not present in quilting.<br>
<br>
Many of these features are illustrated in this screen-dump.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Quilt4.jpg" height="530" width="700"><br>

<em>This is a quilt consisting of three raster charts, two that are 
actually displayed and one smaller scale chart that is hidden behind the
 larger scaled charts of St Croix.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/hidden-quilt.png" height="21" width="150">  This is the button for the not displayed chart in the quilt.<br>
The mouse pointer is over the middle raster chart and the chart 
information box is shown, together with the red highlighting of the 
chart on the screen.<br>
If the chart info box contains much less info than above, just click the
 button to display the chart, then go back and hover with the cursor 
over the chart button again. The full info will now be available.<br>
No depth unit is shown in the quilt as the left chart is in Feet and the
 right in Fathoms and parts thereof. Notice the lack of zoom level in 
the status bar, a quilt , by definition, consists of several different 
zoom levels.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Which charts are quilted?</strong><br>
There are several rules built into OpenCPN governing exactly how different charts reacts to the quilting mode.<br>
<strong>Raster charts</strong> and <strong>Vector charts </strong>are 
quilted separately and don't mix together. You can quilt either raster 
charts or vector charts, but not both at the same time.<br>
<br>
The exception to this rule is that CM93 ver2 charts, if available, are 
shown if no other Mercator chart cover exists for a displayed area, for 
both raster- and vector- chart quilting.<br>
<br>
CM93 chart also kicks in (if available), if the view is so far zoomed out<br>
that the rightmost (smallest scale) raster chart is too small to be 
useful. OpenCPN remembers that this selection of CM93 is due to 
attempted under-zoom of a raster chart. Then, when you zoom in again, it
 tries to return to the raster chart that caused the auto-shift to cm93.
 If that chart is not available, it makes best effort to find a useful 
small scale raster chart.<br>
<br>
Transverse Mercator Charts, which are all raster charts, are strictly 
quilted on their own. In this case, the background map is visible where 
there is no coverage.<br>
Polyconic Charts, which are all raster charts as well, are also quilted 
strictly on their own. The background world map is visible where ther is
 no other chart coverage.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 ver2</strong> charts can be quilted separately.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mercator Charts</strong> are always quilted in quilting mode but don't quilt together with Transverse Mercator charts or Polyconic charts.<br>
<strong>Polyconic Charts</strong>, are quilted separately, and don't mix with Mercator or Transverse Mercator Charts<br>
<strong>Skewed Charts</strong> are allowed in the quilt as long as they don't deviate more than 5 degrees<br>
from North Up.<br>
<strong>Transverse Mercator Charts  </strong>are quilted separately from Mercator- and Polyconic- Charts.<br>
"<strong>BSB4</strong>" and "<strong>nv-charts</strong>", using plugins, quilts with other Raster Charts, following the rules above.<br>
<br>
<strong>User control</strong>.<br>
Users can control if an individual chart, is allowed in the quilt or 
not. Right clicking on any chart in a quilt in the chart-bar and 
clicking "Hide This Chart" on the pop up menu, removes the chart from 
the quilt. The chart button in the Status bar changes to <img alt="" src="images/not_participate.png" height="20" width="60">. The same thing can be achieved through the right-click menu when clicking on a displayed chart.<br>
To activate the chart again right click this button an then click "Ad this chart to quilt"<br>
<br>
<strong>Controlling the scale of the quilt view</strong>.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/quilt-ref.png" height="27" width="600"><br>
The "quilt reference chart" is the left-most, largest scale chart, 
highlighted in the chart bar. This is the left of the two pale blue 
chart buttons above.<br>
Click the next chart blue button "one-to-the-right" of the of the 
current reference chart. The reference scale of the quilt will be 
decreased, but the viewpoint will not change. The same logic applies if 
clicking a chart-to-the-left of the present reference chart, except that
 the scale of the quilt will increase. Zooming in/out will also move the
 reference chart to the left/right.<br>
<br>
<strong>Known issue with some NOAA ENC:s </strong><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/stXhole1.png" height="547" width="600"><br>
<br>
Some NOAA ENC:s are produced with "holes" in. OpenCPNs handles almost 
all of these cases.  The picture above is from S:t Croix in the 
Caribbean, using an old version of OpenCPN. There are still some gray 
areas in this vicinity but only if the scale is larger than 1:10,000. 
Very few users are likely to notice this.<br>
The gray rectangle above is a "hole" in a chart, where a smaller scale 
chart with coverage exists. The "hole" is due to the fact that this area
 wasn't surveyed to the scale of the chart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/opencpn_002.png" align="absMiddle" height="48" width="48">  <em>Go to </em><a href="#TableOfContents"><em>Table Of Contents</em></a><!-- google_ad_section_end -->  </div>

  <h1 id="ChartGroups" class="book-heading">Chart Groups</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
Chart Groups solves the following problem: You may have many charts 
loaded in your active database. Some of them have overlapping coverage 
at the same scale, so that when quilted the logic does not know which of
 potentially several charts at the same scale to choose from. For 
example, in the Bahamas there are a few publishers of charts, covering 
the same areas, with radically different presentations. Sometimes you 
may want to see one set (say planning charts of small scale), and other 
times you only want navigation charts of the best scale possible.<br>
Another example: Pilot charts as one Group, normal navigation charts as 
another Group, makes it possible to quickly switch between them.<br>
<br>
Final example: in another universe, NGA charts in one group, standard NOAA RNCs in another, British UKHO in a third group.<br>
<br>
The Chart Group function allows us to define multiple Groups, with 
different chart directories in each group. It is possible to leave a 
Group empty, in which case only the background chart will be displayed. 
The Group desired for viewing may be selected quickly, through the 
right-click menu, without adding or deleting charts from the Active 
database.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4Chartgroups2.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
In Options -&gt;Charts, select "Chart Groups"<br>
You will see two panes. The top pane contains "All Available Charts", 
which are the charts you have installed. The bottom pane allows you to 
create, edit, and delete Groups. Note that there is always an "All 
Charts" group. This Group is not editable. New Groups which you create 
may have chart directories or individual charts added to them by 
selecting the item in the top pane and touching the "Add" button.<br>
You may also remove individual charts or directories from Groups by 
selecting the desired item in the bottom pane, and touch  "Remove 
Chart". Please note that "removing" an item from the Group does not 
remove it from your "Available" set of charts. The item is simply made 
unavailable when the Group is in use.<br>
It is a good idea to have a empty chart group, only the background Map 
will be shown. "Unlimited" zooming is allowed. This can be usefull for 
very lage scale plotting, for example.<br>
<br>
<br>

<em>In this illustration the navigator generally uses the US charts, 
when available. Coming into Baia do Porto Santo a detailed chart would 
be great, but no such US chart is available on board. A switch to the UK
 chart group solves the problem.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ChartGroups322.jpg" height="412" width="600"><br>
<br>
<br>
Select the Group you want to use, by a right-click context menu item 
called "Chart Groups". As you switch Groups the logic tries to select a 
chart and scale that closely matches the situation present before the 
switch. As you may understand, sometimes the fit is not reasonable, so 
the resulting view may be surprising.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you have no Groups defined, as in the default installation, all installed charts are always available.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chart Groups and CM93</strong><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/cm93grp.png" height="165" width="600"><br>
<br>
It is possible to have multiple instances of CM93v2 in different Chart 
Groups. Above we have 5 instances loaded in various chart groups. The 
view is of "All Active Charts".<br>
OpenCP also supports multiple partial CM93 data sets.<br>
The instances are loaded, from left to right, in the order of the chart groups.<br>
In this situation, only the leftmost instance of CM93, that is not 
excluded from the quilt, will be displayed. Above, it is the instance 
represented by the yellow rectangle.<br>

  <h1 id="VectorCharts" class="book-heading">Vector Charts</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>OpenCPN makes a serious effort to be compliant with IHO standards for ECDIS display of cartography.<br>
<br>
<strong>First</strong>, one very important setting for vector charts is handled directly from the main toolbar.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/text.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> This button toggles all text displayed on a vector chart On and Off.<br>
The hotKey "T" is an alternative for toggling the text.<br>
In OpenGL mode, all text will always be horizontal when using  the "Course Up" option.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Second</strong>, double clicking on a vector chart, as long as 
the cursor hasn't changed to a green arrow near the edges, brings up an 
information dialog, displaying  the available vector-chart information 
at the selected point. Scroll down to see all the information. An 
alternative to double clicking is right-clicking an select "Object 
Query".<br>
Note that a single normal (left) click will center the chart at that point.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/dyngnaset.png" height="500" width="451"><br>
 <br>
The example is taken from double-clicking on a lighthouse in a busy area.<br>
Exactly what is shown in this dialog depend on the settings described below in "Display Categories".<br>
<br>
<strong>Third, </strong>it is  possible to select what font is used for 
the text on vector charts. There is an entry  in 
theToolBox-&gt;Languages/Fonts-&gt;Choose Fonts tab, called <strong>ChartTexts</strong>.
 Here you select what font-face to use, and a template size. Weight and 
final size of the displayed texts depends on the charts you are using, 
but if the charts contain various weights and sizes, they will all scale
 together depending on what size you select.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
<strong>The Options-Charts-Vector Charts Tab is where everything else is handled.</strong><br>
If the S63 chart plugin is active, there will also be a "S63 Charts" tab. Read more about<strong> </strong><em><a href="#S63VectorCharts">S63 Vector Charts</a></em>,when you have read this page.</p>

<h3 id="DisplayCategories">Display Categories</h3>
<strong>If you are new to OpenCPN and vector charts please start with the "All" Display Category</strong>, to avoid risks and possible confusion. More below.<br>
<br>
Navigators has the choice  of three pre-defined, different, 
presentations of ENC content, Base, Standard and All. OpenCPN also has 
the very flexible Mariners Standard, which is better described as 
"Mariners Choice".<br>
 
<h4 id="Base">Base</h4>
Displays general  information, including coastline, safety-contour, isolated danger,<br>
buoy, beacon traffic separation zone, etc.<br>
<br>
From the IMO definitions:<br>
Display Base means the level of SENC information which cannot be removed from<br>
the display, consisting of information which is required at all times in
 all geographic areas and all circumstances. It is not intended to be 
sufficient for safe navigation.
<h4 id="Standard"><br>
Standard</h4>
Everything in "Base" and aids to navigation, fairways, channel limits, restricted navigation zones, restricted areas, etc..

<h4 id="All"><br>
All</h4>
Everything in "Standard" and more. This level shows all informatio, not 
contolled in other settings options. More about what the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ecdis">IMO ECDIS</a>
 says about the content of these three levels. This is also a good 
choice for actual, underway, navigation, avoiding the possible risks 
involved in "Mariners Standard". See more below.<br>
 
<h4 id="MarinersStandard">Mariners Standard</h4>
 Users can use  the filter tick box to set exactly what he or she wants 
displayed. A large set of filters, about 186, can be employed. They are 
all to the IHO S57 standard, but has been given a label that is easy to 
understand.<br>
Note that Mariners Standard gives the user a much wider choice of what 
to display, than approved ECDIS system are allowed. It is for example 
possible to not display items in the Base category.<br>
<br>
These Hot Keys all works in "Mariners standard". Features are toggled on/off with the keys.

<h4 id="Practicalusage">Practical usage</h4>

<p id="GUID-6BCAAD17-7700-4BAD-95FA-552F311BA0FE">A general 
recommendation would be to use the "All" display category or "Mariners 
Standard" with "Select All" marked , and then switch of certain features
 as required.</p>
As an example let's look at passing through the British gas fields in the SW North Sea<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/europe1.jpg" height="415" width="480"><br>
<br>
This is not easy, so we want to get rid of all those red and yellow circles.<br>
Doubble click on one of the platforms, square with a dot.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4Objq.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
At the top it reads "<strong>Light </strong>(Lights)", which means that you clicked on a light, whis belongs to the Feature Class "Lights".<br>
Find "Light" in the Mariners Standard list of available filters, and untick it.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/vector-light.png" height="338" width="234"><br>
<br>
Press the "Apply" button!<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/europe3.png" height="389" width="480"><br>
<br>
Much better!<br>
In this particular case, there is a shortcut which does the same thing. Use the Hot Key "L" to toggle all lights on/off.
<h4 id="Display">Display</h4>

<p><strong>Depth Soundings</strong> turns the depths on and of. Other 
settings also affects when soundings are displayed, for example "Reduced
 Detail at Small Scale". The dark black numbers are not soundings. 
Instead they refer to heights of nearby islets or cays. On official 
paper charts the soundings are printed in italics.</p>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/sounding.png" height="299" width="374"><br>
<br>
The bold number 20 refers to the land height of the unnamed cay SW of the number.<br>
"Safety Depth" is set to 20 m, so the 20 m contour stands out in black.<br>
<br>
How soundings behave when zooming.<br>
"Chart sounding symbols" are represented by small raster images. As a 
chart is zoomed in, these raster symbols will increase in size by about 
2x. Currently they increase in size well after the "Overzoom" notice, 
for the largest scale chart available.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chart Information Objects</strong> relates to information about 
the chart itself. With this switch on, an object query reveals such 
information as the buoyage system for the area, the quality of the 
survey, the latest NTM update and sources for the chart.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/meta.png" height="400" width="400"><br>
 
<h4 id="Buoys/Lights">Buoys/Lights</h4>
 

<p><strong>Bouy/Light Labels</strong>, displays names and purposes of aids to navigation, such as number or name of buoys, information about conspicuous objects etc.</p>

<p><strong>Light Descriptions</strong>, this tick box control display of
 light characteristics. Checking this displays  a label with a text 
describing the marker or lighthouse's characteristics.<br>
 </p>

<p><strong>Extended Light Sectors</strong>. It is often difficult, on a vector chart,  to see exactly what the light-sectors are supposed to do.</p>

<h4 id=""><img alt="" src="images/havannah-noext.png" height="249" width="500"></h4>

<p>Activating the Extended Light sectors clarifies the situation. All 
sectors are extended and leading white sectors are emphasized in yellow 
and extend the full nominal range of the light. Just hold the cursor 
over a ligt and the extended sectors are activated.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/havannah-ext.png" height="254" width="500"><br>
Light sectors as narrow as 0.3° are displayed.<br>
<br>

			2. It is White.<br>
			3. The light also has Red and/or Green sectors.<br>

<h4 id="ChartTexts"><br>
Chart Texts</h4>

<p><strong>National text on chart. </strong>Vector charts may have 
attributes with the texts in the national language. For example a 
Russian chart with texts in Cyrillic. With this option activated OpenCPN
 will display text in the local language and character set, in this case
 Russian written in Cyrillic.</p>
<strong>Important Text Only</strong> displays only a bare minimum of 
text essential for navigation, such as course and bearing in a leading 
line (range) and bridge clearances.

<h4 id=""> </h4>

<p><strong>De-Cluttered Text.</strong> Even when using "Reduced Detail 
at Small Scale", there are cases when text labels overlaps or overwrites
 other labels and creates a cluttered impression. Ticking this box tries
 to clear the view. This setting may hide needed information.<br>
 </p>

<h4 id="ChartDetail">Chart Detail</h4>

<p><strong>Reduced Detail at Small Scale</strong> makes sure that a minimum scale is required  before certain objects are shown. If this box is <strong>not </strong>ticked<strong>, </strong>everything is always shown, leading to very cluttered view at small scale (zoomed out).</p>
 

<h4 id="GraphicsStyle">Graphics Style</h4>
<strong>Paper chart</strong> draw the markers and lights just like the printed paper chart, while <strong>Simplified </strong>uses icons to represent the same. Some like the one and some the other, a matter of taste.<br>
Paper Chart mode closely follows the IHO standard standard in this area.
 This mode is currently more developed than the simplified mode, as it 
has a higher priority in the development effort.<br>
 
<h4 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h4>
<strong>Plain</strong> normally just uses a dashed line, while the <strong>Symbolized </strong>version also uses triangles pointing into the area.<br>
 
<h4 id="Colors">Colors</h4>
Depth on the chart can be displayed with<strong> either 2 or 4 colors</strong>.
 This setting is closely related to the "Depths Settings". With 2 
colors, and using a relatively large scale, areas with depth less than 
"Safety Depth" is blue, the rest is white. With 4 colors, there are 
different colors for areas less than "Shallow Depth", areas between 
"Shallow Depth" and "Safety Depth", areas between "Safety Depth" and 
"Deep Depth" and finally for areas deeper than "Deep Depth".<br>
 
<h3 id="DepthsSettings"><br>
Depths Settings</h3>
<br>
The units for depths is set in Options-&gt;Display-&gt;Units.<br>
<br>
All depths units are rounded off to the nearest number. If the value is 
half way between, the nearest higher number is used. Underlined values 
indicates drying heights.<br>
<strong>Feet</strong><br>
Only whole digits are shown. A value of 12 feet covers all soundings between 11.5 feet and 12.4 feet.
<h4 id="Meters">Meters</h4>
Meters are show as whole numbers for depths greater than 30 m. Depths 
below  30 m are shown as whole meters and decimeters as subscript, like 
this 12<sub>7</sub> This is the same as 12.7 meters and  is shown for all soundings between 12.65 m and 12.74 m.

<h4 id="Fathoms">Fathoms</h4>
Fathoms are show as whole numbers for depths greater than 31 fathoms. 
Depths below this value are shown as whole fathoms and tenths of fathoms
 as subscript. Compare to the notes above for meters.

<h3 id="Shallow, Safety and Deep depths."><br>
<sub>Shallow, Safety and Deep depths</sub>.</h3>
<sub> These settings are very important as they affect how the different depths are colored.<br>
They can help you identify a deep channel for example, or they can, in  
the worst case scenario, prevent you from being aware of a shallow area.<br>
There is no setting that fits all circumstances. For example a Sea Mount
 with a depth of 20m  in the middle of an ocean should be regarded as 
"shallow" and be avoided, while 20 m depth in a harbor approach in 
protected water, probably is safe.<br>
<br>
The Depth Settings controls the coloring of the water as a function of 
depth. By setting the Safety and Deep water right you will have a 
visible border to show when to take care about shallow water. <br>
CM93 charts and ENCS works very similar in this area. The charts 
contains depth area features according to fixed depth cutoff zones, 
usually 5, 10, and 20 meters. Intermediate values are not available in 
the database,if you select a value between those available, OpenCPN 
chooses the next higher value available for display of color.<br>
The charts are inconsistent in this area, depending on the country 
issuing the original  charts. For example in UK and the Netherlands the 
depth contours in CM93 are 2, 5 and 10 meter while in US the are based 
on feet but expressed in meters, such as  3.7, 5.5, 9.1 and 18.3 m.<br>
Generally for both  ENC and CM93, find these fixed depth cutoffs by 
double-clicking so the Object Query dialog pops up. The last entry is 
usually  Depth Area. The two values in the range, represents these built
 in cutoffs.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/dpare.png"><br>
<em>An example from UK with cutoff values of 5m and 10m.</em><br>
<br>
If for example, as is the case on the South China Sea Hydrographic 
Commissions charts, the shallowest area has a   range "0 m - 10 m", 
there is, in most cases, no point in setting "Shallow Depth" to anything
 but 10 m.<br>
Find out these cut off depth for your area and set the "Depth Settings" 
with this knowledge together with your preferences and activity.<br>
<br>
With all the reservations above, the general case for 4 colors, will be described. </sub>

<h4 id="ShallowDepth"><br>
<sub>Shallow Depth</sub></h4>
<sub> will color all water areas with water depths shallower than the set depth to a dark blue color. Soundings are in black. </sub>

<h4 id="SafetyDepth"><br>
<sub>Safety Depth</sub></h4>
<sub> Water deeper that Shallow but shallower that this depth will have a
 paler blue color. The  Shallow Depth contour clearly marked with a 
thicker black borderline. Soundings less than this depth are in black, 
while soundings greater than this value are gray. </sub>

<h4 id="DeepDepth"><br>
<sub>Deep Depth</sub></h4>

display a light gray color. The Safety Depth contour  is clearly marked 
with black borderline. Water deeper than Deep Depth is displayed in 
white.<br>
<br>
<strong>Finally</strong> a word about <strong>drying heights</strong>, 
displayed in green. There is no detailed information available for 
drying heights, neither in CM93 ver2 nor in many ENC charts. Some ENC 
charts have negative ranges, for example "-2 m - 0 m" in areas with 
drying heights. This adds very little, as it really only gives the 
information that the drying height is less than the first value in the 
range, in an area of unspecified size.<br>
This situation is changing though. A set of new charts released in april
 2012, by the Dutch Authorities, sets a standard for others to follow in
 this regard. See picture below. Modern Australian S63 charts are 
equally good.<br>

The CM93 <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/charts.html" title="View more discussions on Charts">charts</a>
 slider control that allows the user to adjust the screen complexity to 
suit the actual situation as well as the available processor capability.<br>
Normal settings depend on a combination of personal preferences and 
present usage of map. To see more details, the "CM93 Detail Level" 
slider, can be set to a higher positive number or for navigation in 
shipping lanes to a negative numbers. Typical zoom level 5 is good for 
fishing when as much details are possible is of interest. Zoom level of 
+1, zero or -1 is usually fine for normal use.<br>
Positive values give more detail, but at a cost:<br>
a. It simply takes longer to render larger scale charts covering more screen real estate.<br>
b. There will be more instances of gray (NODATA) areas surrounding the 
larger scale charts as you zoom out, unless quilting is activated.<br>
c. It can become dramatically slower if high detail is specified, and 
chart outlines are requested. In this case, the program has to read a 
lot more cells to get their outlines.<br>
<br>
Conversely, negative values give less detail. Zooms are faster.<br>
<br>
The slider can also be activated through the "d" hotkey, and displayed directly on the screen.<br>

S63 is an encrypted version of S57 vector charts, and is the standard 
format for almost all, officially published, vector charts in today’s 
world. As a matter of fact, only NOAA and the East Asia Hydrographic 
Commission (EAHC), publishes free unencrypted S57 charts nowadays.<br>
<br>
These, S57 and S63 charts, are the current state of the art charts. The 
quality of the charts are the best vector charts available. They are 
always kept up to date. No other vector chart are in the same league.<br>
There are, however also some drawbacks. Many popular cruising areas are 
very poorly covered as the focus is on the needs for commercial 
shipping. One example is he Bahamas area. Another problem is the 
relatively high price.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN handles these commercial, non free, charts through an open 
source plugin, that in the background connects to a "black box" helper 
application. An external entity, <strong><a href="http://o-charts.org/">o-charts.org</a></strong>, handles the encrypted and commercial aspects of the S-63 plug-ins for OpenCPN.<br>

<h4 id="RasterCharts">Raster Charts</h4>

<p><strong>BSB Versions 1, 2 and 3, with chart files ending with ".kap".</strong><br>
Non standard coded "skewed" charts, are handled through internal calculations.<br>
This takes care of a few charts from "Solteknik HB", and possibly others.<br>
<br>
<strong>BSB Version 4 </strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".cap"</strong>, works with a non free plugin, for Windows only. See the <a href="http://opencpn.org/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a> download page.<br>
<br>
<strong>"nv-charts" with chart files ending with ".eap"</strong>, are supported through  a non free plugin, for Windows only. See the <a href="http://opencpn.org/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a> download page.<br>
<br>
<strong>NOS/GEO Version 1</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".nos" and ".geo".</strong> (Subsequent versions are probably supported but need to be tested. However, this format is obsolete for new charts.)<br>
 </p>

<h4 id="VectorCharts">Vector Charts</h4>

<p><strong>S57 ENC charts</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".000". </strong><br>
ENC update files (ending with .001, .002, ...) are included 
automatically, if present, and must be placed in the same directory as 
the corresponding base chart (.000). OpenCPNs internal<strong> </strong>SENC files has a ".S57" file extension.<br>
<br>
If a chart is said to be a S57 Vector chart, and has a different file 
ending, it is likely to be a SENC file, a processed version of a ".000" 
chart file, in a proprietary, platform specific format, that OpenCPN 
can't handle.<br>
<br>
<strong>S63 Encrypted ENC charts, with chart files ending with ".os63".</strong><br>
This chart format is supported in OpenCPN from version 4. It is the 
format for all vector charts from national hydrographic offices 
worldwide. Apart from being encrypted, S63 charts are exactly the same 
as S57.</p>
All S63 chart worldwide, are available for purchase. The support is 
through a two part plugin, one part open source and the other part 
closed. <strong>The encryption and the commercial aspect is handled by a separate  entity,  <a href="http://www.o-charts.org/">o-charts.org</a></strong>

<p><strong>CM93 Version 2.</strong><br>
(C-map Version 3, and later, are in a preprocessed proprietary SENC format  and are not supported.)</p>

<p>Generally chart pictures in <strong>gif, jpeg, pdf, png, tif, bmp </strong>and other formats can be used, when properly geo-referenced, to generate raster<strong> </strong>charts. For the details about this process read the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/chart_conversion_manual"><em>Chart Conversion Manual</em></a>.  Also, make sure to browse around the forum as there are a handful of  interesting chart related threads.</p>

<p><strong>WCI</strong> charts generated with <a href="http://www.sping.com/seaclear/">SeaClear and MapCal </a>can
 also be transformed to BSB charts and used by OpenCPN. The key is to 
open a WCI chart in MapCal and then "Tools-&gt;Convert-&gt;Current WCI 
to BMP" to convert the chart to a BMP picture. More about using MapCal, a
 part of SeaClear, for chart conversions, is available here: <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/chart_conversion_linux"><em>Conversion Using Linux</em></a>. MapCal works just fine with Linux, using Wine.<br>

<b>OziExplorer</b><b><i> </i></b>charts consisting of picture in one of the standard formats, together with a georeferencing "<strong>.map</strong>" file, can be converted to a bsb kapfile. A Ruby script for this conversion is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/map2kap_0.1.11.rb_.zip"><strong>here</strong></a> and a more developed windows version<a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/map2kap-oziexplorer-to-opencpn-47828-10.html#post929755"><strong> here.</strong></a>
  Ozi charts of the ozfx2 or ozfx3 format can not be converted with this
 tool. These Ozi formats are not documented and proprietary, and cannot 
be displayed in OpenCPN.</p>

<p> The <strong>HDR/PCX </strong>charts, used prior to the BSB format, 
was used from the late eighties to mid nineties. While these charts 
cannot be used directly in OpenCPN, the chart-picture as such, can be 
extracted. These charts consists of many picture tiles in <strong>pcx </strong>format,
 more than 100 tiles is not unusual. The tiles can be merged to one big 
picture, and then used as any other picture, to make an OpenCPN 
compatible chart. For details on this process see the<a href="http://opencpn.org/chart_conversion_linux"> <em>Chart Conversion Manual</em></a>  and <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/open-chart-standard-32731-4.html#post381315">this post</a> and the following posts in the forum. A script for merging the pcx tiles to one picture is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/pcx2tif.zip">here.</a></p>

<p> The HDR format is from an era when computer-memory and processing 
power were less powerful than today, as a consequence these charts are 
not of the same quality as more modern charts. Furthermore, most of 
these charts are not using WGS 84 as reference datum. These charts 
should not be the first choice, but can be useful if nothing else is 
available.</p>

<h3 id="Other formats that are not supported.">Other formats that are <em>not</em> supported.</h3>
The Hydrographic Chart Raster Format, <strong>HCRF</strong>, used by the
 United Kingdom Hydrographic Offices' ARCS (Admiralty Raster Chart 
Service).  This is also due to proprietary encryption algorithms and 
copyright issues. UKHO is now alone in using this format, since New 
Zeeland switched to the BSB/Kap format and Australia no longer publishes
 official raster charts.

<p><br>
Charts from<strong> Mapmedia</strong>, <strong>Navionics</strong>, <strong>C-map</strong>(with the exception of CM93 version 2), <strong>Garmin</strong>
 and various other private vendors, are not supported, for the same 
reasons as for the other proprietary charts. It is not possible for 
users to convert these charts to an OpenCPN recognized format, but it is
 possible for these companies, to release OpenCPN plugins, <strong>if</strong> they  whish.<br>

The motivation for releasing these charts is well worth reading.
	<p><cite>Realizing that official and high quality small scale ENCs 
conforming with the established IHO standard were not available for the 
SCS, the EAHC MSs decided to cooperate closely and resolve the situation
 so that mariners could use most up-to-date chart information for voyage
 planning and enhancing safety of navigation, rather than resorted to 
some commercially developed electronic products which were either 
prepared in proprietary formats, or containing unofficial data with very
 infrequent updating... It was the view that if the SCS ENC could be 
freely and widely available to mariners, it would further enhance the 
safety of navigation in the region. This in turn could reduce the 
chances of environmental damage from grounding and oil pollution, which 
have tremendous cost impact. The EAHC decided to provide the SCS ENC to 
users free of charge.</cite></p>

many formats (including KAP which work with OpenCPN). This project 
relies on mariners to survey their local waters and upload their data 
using the OpenStreetMap database and editing tools. This project is 
still in its infancy, so only a few areas have been mapped to any 
extent. Currently only sea-marks are displayed, but it is planned to 
include depth &amp; other data in due course. For the maps, go to: <a href="http://openseamap.org/index.php?id=openseamap&amp;L=1">openseamap.org</a></li>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><ul>
	<li>Clicking the <strong>Auto Follow</strong> button <img alt="" src="images/auto-follow_0.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">
 will center the chart directly on your vessel's current location. This 
is a toggle button that is slightly larger and greyer when on. If the 
the gps is working  own ship is red <img alt="" src="images/ship_red.png" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19"> otherwise the icon is gray. <img alt="" src="images/ship_grey.png" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19">. It's also possible that a yellow own ship icon will appear. Read more: <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/gps_status"><em>GPS Status</em> .</a> Read If zoomed out to a scal that is smaller than 1:300.000 the icons changes to <img alt="" src="images/own5.png" align="absMiddle" height="30" width="31">, when receiving gps signals and <img alt="" src="images/own4.png" align="absMiddle" height="31" width="30"> otherwise. More about he OwnShip icon is available in  <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/marks_and_routes#ownship"><em>Marks and Routes</em>.</a></li>
	<li>The default own ship icon can be replaced by  putting a file 
"ownship.png" in the User icons shared data directory. More about this  
shared directory here: <a href="#MarksandRoutes"><em>Marks and Routes</em></a></li>
	<li>The Auto Follow button useful for two different situations:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>When you have panned the map away from your current location and want to quickly move back to your vessel.</li>
	<li>When underway, this will keep the display on the chart around your vessel, with the boat at the center of the chart.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Panning the chart will disable Auto Follow mode. Simply click <img alt="" src="images/auto-follow_0.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> again to turn <strong>Auto Follow</strong>
 mode back on. Zooming in/out with the scrollwheel is OK as no panning 
takes place unless Options-&gt;Display-&gt;"Zoom-to Cursor" is ticked.</li>
	<li>There are three main options for display orientation, normally it is <strong>North Up</strong> but <strong>Course Up</strong>
 is an alternative. With Course Up OpenCPN uses COG (Course Over 
Ground). A head Up mode, is not available. The easiest way to change 
between these two modes is through the "Right Click" menu. One situation
 where course up might be considered is when navigating a river or a 
canal. The third orientation is when skew charts are displayed, they are
 simply shown as "<strong>Chart Up</strong>",  but an optional setting exist to show them as "North Up".</li>
	<li>In the picture below the Course Up is active. COG is 41Deg. Notice 
how all text on the vector chart, is aligned correctly. This only works 
in OpenGL mode. The red arrow, in the upper right corner, is always 
pointing North.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/course-up.jpg" height="605" width="800">
<ul>
	<li><span>If the option "Show skewed raster charts as North-up" in the Options-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced tab, is <strong>not</strong>
 ticked, the right-click toggle option "Course Up Mode/North Up Mode" 
will be replaced by "Course Up Mode /Chart Up Mode", for skewed charts.</span></li>
	<li>If an electronic compass is available in the NMEA stream the own 
ship icon will be orientated according to this heading. The difference 
can be seen on the chart if there is a cross current, for example.  The 
boat below is heading WNW but is being set SW. An AIS CPA, Closest Point
 of Approach is also visible. </li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/dashn3.png" align="textTop" height="187" width="200"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li><img alt="" src="images/north-up.png" align="absMiddle" height="34" width="29">  This icon (blue color) to the far right in the ToolBar indicates that the display is in <strong>North Up </strong>mode. It may also indicate Chart Up mode for skewed charts, if chart up mode instead of North up mode i selected. See above</li>
	<li><img alt="" src="images/course-up_0.png" align="absMiddle" height="28" width="28"> The red version of the icon indicates <strong>Course Up </strong>
 mode. Clicking the icon toggles North Up / Course up. These settings 
can also be toggled in the rightclick menu, as well as in Options -&gt; 
Display -&gt;General Tab. In the Options-Display-&gt;Advanved Tab, the 
update period for course up, can be set. This comes in handy, for 
example, to prevent the display jerking around in a chop.</li>
	<li>The Course Up/North Up icon share a small dialog with the GPS 
indicator. This dialog can be toggled on/of with the "Ctrl + i" 
shortcut.</li>
	<li>Note that both the red and the blue arrows are <strong>always</strong> pointing North.</li>
	<li><strong>Look Ahead!</strong> To see more of the chart in front of 
the boat, activate Options -&gt; Display -&gt; Look Ahead  Mode. Your 
own boat will no longer be in the center of the screen. Instead it will 
be located away from the center, in the opposite direction to your 
present gps course(COG).</li>
	<li><strong>Don't always Look Ahead!</strong> If you are at anchor, 
swinging on the hook produces random courses and low speeds.If Look 
Ahead is on in this situation  the chart rendering will constantly be 
redrawn, with the boat in all possible lookahead positions as the course
 changes. To prevent this kind of scenario OpenCPN works like this:<br>
	*If the boat speed is less than 1 kt, then lookahead is disabled.<br>
	*If boat speed is greater than 3 kts, lookahead is enabled.<br>
	*In between 1 and 3 kts, the lookahead "distance" is adjusted smoothly.<br>
	*If  the problems still there when doing more than 3 kts, consider 
using  "Options-&gt;Connections -&gt; FilterNMEA Course and Speed data" 
 to average out the "jumpiness".</li>
	<li><strong>Show skewed raster charts as North-up</strong>. Skewed 
charts are normally showed "chart up", as intended by design. If ticking
 this box, these charts are shown North-Up. In both cases, activating 
course up, works as expected, the difference is when course up is <strong>n</strong><strong>ot</strong> on.</li>
	<li><strong>Full Screen</strong>. Enter Full Screen Mode with the F11 
toggle. Toggling full scree is also possible through the Menu Bar -&gt; 
View. Once in full screen mode the Right-Click-menu contains the item 
"Toggle Full Screen".</li>

	In the <b>[Settings/Others]</b> section you can set the option <b>CurrentArrowScale </b>to
 a positive number representing a percentage scaling factor of the 
current arrows. The values bellow 100 mean the arrows will be smaller

</ul>

<h2 id="Usingalternativedatasets"> Using alternative data sets</h2>

<ul>
	<li>OpenCPN supports two tidal file formats. Xtides .tcd file format as
 well as the default .IDX type. The latter consits of a pair of files 
called HARMONIC and HARMONIC.IDX, in a directory.</li>
	<li>The default, IDX dataset for tides and currents is limited, mainly for copyright reasons.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flaterco.com/">Xtide</a>, a well known free 
software tidal aplication (GPL license), maintains regularly updated 
.tcd files for US. Updated files are normally published in December each
 year. These are presently the only area with, up to date freely 
available, tidal data. The latest updates are available from the Xtide 
site, <a href="http://www.flaterco.com/"> http://www.flaterco.com</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/">ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/</a>. The "non-free" dataset, including UK and the Netherlands, is no longer updated. The last update was published 2011.</li>
	<li>Please note that OpenCPN differs from XTide results, in very small 
amounts, usually a few minutes, regarding the times of slack water. This
 is due to the older algorithm used in OpenCPN compared to the most 
modern XTides implementation of subordinate station time offset 
calculation</li>
	<li>There is currently has a problem when multiple .tcd files are 
loaded. The reference station may be incorrectly identified. In 
practical navigation only one .tcd file is needed at any given time, 
depending on which side of the Atlantic you are navigating.</li>
	<li>A number of different datasets are available on the Internet, with 
vastly greater coverage. Some of these datasets are quite old, and they 
also contains glitches and errors, many of which have been corrected in 
the OpenCPN default dataset.</li>
	<li>In many areas there are no free alternatives, and OpenCPN makes it 
possible to switch between data sets and even using them at the same 
time. If two stations are located on exactly the same position, only one
 will be visible......</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/4OptChartTide.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li>Go to Options-&gt;Charts-&gt;Tides &amp; Currents. Press "Add Dataset.." to add another dataset.</li>
	<li>Tidal files can be located anywhere on your file system, but it 
will pay off to be organized. The first entry above shows the default 
location for the built in datafile on Linux. On windows a typical

are the basic points that is used for many things, such as creating 
routes, marking fishing spots, good anchorages or anything of interest.<br>
<br>
Once a mark is created a focused right-click dialog becomes available, when clickin on the mark.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/wpt_focus2.png"><br>
 
<h5 id="Creatingamark">Creating a mark</h5>
There are a few ways to directly create marks.

<ul>
	<li>Pressing "Ctrl +O" creates a mark at the boats position.</li>
	<li>"Ctrl + M" creates a mark at the cursor position.</li>
	<li>Right-click and and press "Drop Mark" creates a mark, at the position of the cursor, when clicking.</li>
	<li>Marks are created at the start of each leg in a route, and one at 
the end of the route. More about routes a bit further down this page.</li>
</ul>
Marks created these ways will have a triangular icon, except for routes that uses a diamond, but no name.<br>
<br>
The default icon, when creating a mark, is settable by changing the the value <b>"DefaultWPIcon"</b> in the opencpn.ini(config) file. Use the name of any available icon in the properties dialog.<br>
 
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

<p>You can <strong>move </strong>the mark by left-click-dragging it around.</p>

<p>You can <strong>delete</strong> a mark by right-clicking its icon, and selecting "Delete".<br>
There is an built in <strong>undo/redo </strong>buffer for creating, 
deleting or moving marks or waypoints. If you have just created, deleted
 or moved a mark the right-click dialog will have relevant entries. The 
undo/redo, for moving or creating marks, follows a straight time-line 
and is not tied to an individual mark.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/rc_wpt-del-mv.png" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="288"><br>
<br>
Above is a right-click menu just after moving a mark a few times and 
undoing the last move, and one mark was deleted, and then the deletion 
was undone. CTRL + Z and  CTRL + Y works as hot-keys for undo/redo.<br>
<br>
All marks have properties that can be seen by right-clicking and 
pressing "Properties", or even simpler just double click the mark.<br>
<strong>Read all about the properties dialog in </strong><a href="#ExtendedMarks"><em><strong>Extended Marks</strong></em></a><br>
Marks can be manipulated through the Route &amp; Mark Managers Waypoints
 tab as well. Deleting a mark that is part of a route, will also change 
the route. Marks that are a part of a "layer" cannot be changed at all. 
Marks can also be imported into OpenCPN in a number of ways.<br>
<strong>Read all about this in the  </strong><a href="#TheRouteManagerandGpxData"><em><strong>The Route Manager and Gpx Data</strong></em></a><br>
<br>
A general  locking of  all marks is available. Goto Options -&gt; Display -&gt;Advanced<br>
<img alt="" src="images/lockwpt.png" height="45" width="471"><br>
and tick the box. This feature is handy, to prevent accidentally moving a
 mark. Activate this feature when underway, deactivate it when planning.<br>
<br>
The <a href="#ManOverBoard"><em>Man Over Board</em></a> mark  can be activated through the icon <img alt="" src="images/mob_btn.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">
 in the toolbar, or through hitting Ctrl + Space-bar. The mark looks 
like the button and is dropped on own boats present gps position. This 
mark cannot be moved or deleted with the cursor or keyboard (by 
mistake), but can still be deleted from the Route/Waypoint manager 
dialog. More about <a href="#ManOverBoard"><em>Man Over Board</em></a> here.<br>

<h3 id="UseyourownIcons">Use your own Icons</h3>
OpenCPN comes with a handful of different icons that can be assigned to a
 mark. Right click or use the Route Manager and activate the properties 
dialog. The Mark Icon window in the dialog shows the available icons. <br>
<br>
A user can install his or her own icons to use with marks and "own ship".<br>
<br>
1. Create a directory called "UserIcons" in the same place that holds 
your opencpn.ini(config) file. Instructions to find the directory 
(folder) location here:<a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a><br>
<br>
2. Add .png image files to this directory. The legacy .xpm format works 
as well. The icons can be any size. The name of the file (without the 
extension) becomes the name of the new waypoint icon. These new icons 
will appear on the Waypoint Properties dialog, and can be assigned to 
any waypoint. They can also be assigned in GPX Import files.<br>
<br>
3. The <a href="http://opencpn.org/drupal/user_icons">User Icons</a> page contains links to a few sets of user contributed icons.<br>
<br>
<a name="#"></a>4.To replace the default own ship icon <img alt="" src="images/ship_red.png" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19">
 , just  put a file "ownship.png" or "ownship.xpm", containing the 
ownship picture you prefer, in the UserIcons directory, described above.<br>
More about "ownship" icons and setting "ownship" size in <a href="#SettingOptions"><em>Setting Options</em></a><em>.</em>

<h3 id="Routes"><br>
Routes</h3>

<p>Press the <img alt="" src="images/route_002.png" height="32" width="32">
 -button and start  the creation of a route. Hotkey "CTRL R" is an 
alternative way to start a route and "Esc" ends the route. The cursor 
changes to a  (<img alt="" src="images/pencil2.png" align="absBottom" height="16" width="31">
 ) pencil. Left click along the desired route you want to make. This 
will leave sequential numbered waypoints as you click along, the numbers
 will not be visible, but are available in the Route Properties Dialog, 
accessible through the right click menu or the Route Manager. The 
running total distance of the whole route will be shown along the 
"pencil" together with the course and distance from the last marked 
waypoint. When creating routes, OpenCPN will ask if it should use a 
nearby mark, when a route point is added that is close to an already 
existing mark. If answering "yes", the existing mark is copied to the 
route.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/gc1.png" height="244" width="500"><br>
<br>
For longer distances, specially on east.west courses on higher 
latitudes, the Create Rout  tool seamlessly switches to also offer a 
great circles alternative, instead of Mercator rhumb-line route legs. 
Read more <a href="#Great-circleSailing"><em>Great-circle Sailing</em></a>.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Route-rollover.jpg" height="535" width="650"><br>
Holding the cursor over the route brings up a roll-over info. The name 
of the route, if it is set in the properties dialog, the total length of
 the route, the course and distance for the leg under the cursor and 
distance run so far along the route, to the first waypoint in the 
current leg.<br>
Looking at the four legged route above. The total distance is 8.8 NMi. 
The third leg is 1.89 NMi i true direction 160° and the accumulated 
distance in the first two legs is 4.76 NMi.<br>
<br>
If your desired route extends off the currently displayed chart, move 
the route cursor in the desired direction and the display will 
automatically pan to show the area.  You can zoom in and out with the 
mouse scroll wheel or keyboard +/- keys during route creating.  You can 
also right click and select 'MAX DETAIL HERE' or 'Scale Out' during 
route creation. When finished right click and choose end route from the 
context menu, alternatively just press the "Esc" key.<br>
You should now have an inactive (Blue) route.  Active routes are Red, inactivated routes are Blue.<br>
Right-clicking on a route brings up a focused menu<br>

<h3 id="MultipleRoutes"><br>
Multiple Routes</h3>

<p>In OpenCPN multiple routes can be handled in a couple of different ways.<br>
Many routes can be created in a session or imported into a session.<br>
The visibility of every route is controlled in the Route Manager. There 
is an "eye" to the far left on the line for each route. This works as a 
toggle switch. A PLAIN  Eye means that the route is visible, while an 
eye with a red cross, means that it's hidden.<br>
This way only the route(s) of interest for the moment can be shown.<br>
<br>
Another way is to create and export routes, and later import them when needed.<br>
To keep the chart clear of useful, but not needed routes follow these steps:<br>
• Create a folder called, 'GPX_Routes', or another suitable name.<br>
• Create your route.<br>
• Use the Route Manager to export the route, with a descriptive file name and save it in GPX_Routes.<br>
• Delete the route from the chart.<br>
• You can export all your routes as one big file or export and delete a route as you create them<br>
• When needed, simply use the Route Managers "Import" Button to open the route file. <br>
 </p>

<p>To get rid of the way points left on the chart when a route has been 
imported and then deleted, which may happen depending on the imported 
gpx file.</p>

<p>1. Open the Route Managers Waypoint tab and press the "Delete All" button<br>
2. Say 'Yes' to: 'Are you sure you want to delete &lt;ALL&gt; waypoints?'</p>

<h3 id="Activatingandusingroutes">Activating and using routes</h3>
Right clicking on the track, changes the color from blue to orange and brings up a comprehensive menu.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ZeroXTE.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Clicking "Activate Route" or performing the same action through the 
Route Manager, changes the route color to red and new, route information
 window appears on the right side of the display. Once a route is 
activated, you are presented with the choice of "Deactivate Route" in 
the different menus.<br>
<br>
There is one unique item in the route focused right-click menu above.<br>
<br>
<strong>Zero XTE</strong> Sets the present XTE (Cross Track Error) to 
zero. This comes in handy if you for some reason if off course following
 a route and want the autopilot to follow the route, but adjusted for 
your current position rather than the position of the last route 
waypoint.<br>
<br>
Right clicking on a waypoint in a route brings up a few options, otherwise not available.<br>
 
<ul>
	<li><img alt="" src="images/activeroutewpt.png" height="222" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="206"></li>
	<li><strong>Properties</strong>. The dialog is the same as for an individual mark.</li>
	<li><strong>Activate </strong>- Gives the direction to the chosen 
waypoint instead of the first waypoint in the route, which is the 
default. Useful when joining, for example, an imported route, at an 
arbitrary waypoint.</li>
	<li><strong>Remove</strong> from Route, but don't delete it.</li>
	<li><strong>Copy as kml,</strong> for use with Qtvlm or Google Earth.</li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong> Waypoint from Route.</li>
	<li><strong>Send to GPS</strong> is seen in the rightclick menus for 
routes and waypoints. If a port is not selected, the case in the picture
 above, a dialog is shown to select an output port. To change the 
selected port, go to the route manager and select "Send to GPS".</li>
	<li><strong>Ctrl + N</strong>, a shortcut that activates the next waypoint in an active route.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="AutopilotsandRoutes">Autopilots and Routes</h3>
If an autopilot output port is defined in  the Options-&gt;Connections 
tab, OpenCPN sends instructions to the A/P when a route is active. 
OpenCPN creates and sends the NMEA RMC sentence to the A/P output  port 
when a route is activated. Read more in <a href="#SettingOptions"><em>Setting Options</em></a>.<br>
OpenCPN automatically shifts to the next waypoint in the route using an 
arrival radius of 0.05 miles (= 92.6 m) by default. This value can be 
changed in Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;Own Ship. The arrival radius can be 
adjusted in each waypoint properties dialog as well.<br>
This works fine in the general case. The A/P is watching the RMB 
strings. It sees a new destination lat/lon, and new heading to steer, 
and then asks the user for confirmation to make the turn. 
Raytheon/Autohelm work this way.<br>
Some advance options for Routes ans AutoPilotsare discussed in <em><a href="#SettingOptions">Setting Options</a></em>.<br>

  turns tracking on and off. When tracking is on, the button becomes 
slightly larger and darker (shown here). Tracking means that a record is
 kept of the vessels position as it proceeds. A trail is left behind the
 vessel.<br>
Tracking is persistent. If you shut down OpenCPN with tracking active, 
tracking will be activated automatically next time you start. Note 
however that tracking on start up is delayed until a GPS position is 
available. This action avoids large nonsense jumps in the beginning of 
the new track.<br>
The way the track is recorded can be set in Options -&gt; Ships -&gt; Ownship.<br>
A full explanation is available in <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/setting_options#own"><em>Ownship</em></a><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/tracks.png" height="164" width="600"><br>
<br>
Recorded tracks can be imported, exported and managed using the <a href="#TheRouteManagerandGpxData"><em>The Route Manager and Gpx Data</em></a>.<br>
<br>
When right clicking on a track you can select Track Properties from the 
context menu, and a new dialog pops up. Normally it looks like this:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4RightclickTrack.png"><br>
<br>
But if the track is a layer or part of a layer, you will see this instead:<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4RightclickLayerTrack.png"><br>
A layer cannot be changed easily, and a lot of what follows does not apply to Layer Tracks. Read more about <em><a href="#Layers">Layers</a></em>.<br>
<br>
The properties dialog can also be reached through the Route Manager. A 
record of all the track point will be listed. On the screen dump below 
the tracking precision is set to "Medium". The Waypoints, track points 
really, appears at irregular times, due to the smart tracking. Only 
trackpoints that contributes to the track are recorded. In other words, a
 change in the track occurs at every recorded trackpoint.<br>
Click  anywhere on a line in the list of track points, to mark the line and a blue square will mark the position on the track.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/track-prop1.png" height="293" width="400"><br>
<br>
From the right click menu the Delete track option is available as well. To prevent mistakes a confirmation dialog pops up.<br>
For more about Tracks read about the Route Managers Track Tab in <a href="#TheRouteManagerandGpxData"><em>The Route Manager and Gpx Data</em></a>.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4TrackProperties.png" width="600"><br>
<br>
There ar many options for how a track will be shown and what time to use.<br>
The <strong>Advanced </strong>tab, were you can document the track and include links, works similar to <em><a href="#ExtendedMarks">Extended Marks</a></em>.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->Man Over Board, MOB, can be handled <strong>manually,</strong> by pressing a button on the screen, or hit a shortcut key sequence.<br>
Mob can also be handled <strong>automatically</strong>, or semi-automatically, provided that the crew is equipped with the right gear.<br>
<br>
In any case ...receiving a signal from an AIS SART or PLB will always

<h3 id="MOB activated manually.">MOB activated manually.</h3>
<br>
Drop a Man Over Board Marker at your present position by pressing<br>
<strong>* Man Over Board Button</strong> <img alt="" src="images/mob_btn.png" align="absBottom" height="32" width="32">  on the ToolBar. This button will always be furthest to the right among the buttons, for ease of finding.<br>
or hit the<strong> </strong>Keys<br>
<strong>*Ctrl + Space bar</strong>.<br>
<br>
A mark, looking like the button is instantly created - the MOB mark.<br>
The MOB mark will be called "MAN OVERBOARD at + time-stamp"<br>
<br>
A temporary route, <strong>from </strong>a point 1 mile ahead on the current COG, and <strong>to </strong>the
 MOB mark is created and activated. On the screen, a course and bearing 
to the MOB mark will be displayed. This temporary triangular mark is 
labeled "1.0 NM along COG".<br>
<br>
If COG, course over ground, is not available, no route is created but 
the MOB position is marked. This can happen if no GPS is connected, if 
the GPS signal is (temporary) unavailable or if the speed is so low that
 the GPS doesn't calculate COG.<br>
<br>
<strong>The MOB mark is persistent</strong><br>
If OpenCPN is shut down OpenCPN by misstake, and you have to restart, the MOB mark will still be there.<br>
<br>
<strong>To delete a MOB</strong><br>
The temporary route can be deleted, through the right-click menu, but no
 action of the user with the mouse or keyboard will move or delete the 
MOB mark, except for a right click -&gt; Mark/Wpt Properties and <strong>select a different icon</strong>,
 and then delete the mark (ex mob mark) from the right click menu, or 
through the Route Manager.  A MOB mark is not included in "Delete All" 
in the Toute Manager, to avoid mistakes. The mark has to be selected 
alone and then "Deleted".<br>
<br>
Multiple MOB marks can be deployed, and multiple temporary routes will 
be created. The active route will always be associated with the last 
dropped MOB mark.<br>
<br>
Be very careful when using this capability in waters with strong tide or current.<br>
The person overboard will <strong>not</strong> be at the position of the
 MOB mark for long. Both Own Boat and the person in the water will move 
with the current, but OpenCPN knows nothing about this.<br>
<br>
The MOB mark has just been dropped<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4MOB1.png" width="650"><br>

This works if each person onboard has a personal "AIS-SART" or "PLB(AIS)" and carry them at all times.<br>
The transponder must also be activated, either manually by the MOB or automatically.<br>
OpenCPN  should be set to treat the MMSI of the crew devices as  MOB events.<br>
Do this by going to Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;MMSI Properties-&gt;New and enter the MMSI number of a device.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4MOB6.png"><br>
Mark "Always track" and  "Handle this MMSI as SART/PLB(AIS) MOB", and 
press OK. Do the same thing for each AIS emergency device on board. They
 should now all appear in the list at the "MMSI Properties" tab.<br>
<br>
Next set up Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;Ais Targets-&gt;"Play Sound on 
CPA/TCPA and DSC/SART emergencies" including "Select Alert Sound".<br>
<br>
With this setup a MOB will generate an alarm and OpenCPN will start a  
MOB event as described above under "MOB activated manually".<br>
 
<h3 id="Otherwise.....">Otherwise.....</h3>
An active SART or PLB(AIS) will generate an emergency alarm (if this is

OpenCPN will keep the scale from the last chart, when switching, not 
exactly, but generally of the same magnitude. The zoom-factor will 
increase as you switches to smaller scale charts.<br>

<br>
<strong>Zoom to Cursor</strong>: Normally when clicking on the screen, 
the display centers on the clicked point. The wheel zooms in/out always 
using the center of the display. With this box ticked,  the zooming 
happens at the point of the cursor. This means that as soon as you start
 to zoom in the cursor stays in the same place on the screen and on 
approximately the same geographical position. The advantage is that the 
zooming in position can be fine tuned just using the cursor.<br>
The "Zoom in" and "Zoom Out" buttons, as well as the short cuts "+" and 
"-", will still use the center of the display for zooming, even when 
"Zoom to Cursor" is on.<br>

<strong>Bearings<br>
Show Magnetic bearings and headings</strong>: OpenCPN by default uses 
true courses and bearings etc. This box is for navigators who prefers to
 work with magnetic courses and bearings, or want to test this method. 
Note that OpenCPN knows nothing about deviation.<br>
All courses and bearings will have a (M) post-fix, to show that they are magnetic.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/magnetic_show.png"><br>
The following settings will be affected: Bearings and Courses in the 
Route Properties dialog, route leg rollovers, and Active Route console 
will be (M). COG displayed on the bottom status line will be COG(M). AIS
 target reports will show target COG(M).<br>
Variation will be calculated at Own Ships position, if possible. AIS 
targets however, will use the targets position for variation, if 
possible.<br>
<br>
How does OpenCPN know about the variation?
<ol>
	<li>If a GPS receiver that reports variation as part of RMC sentence, is available, this value will be used.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the WMM plugin is installed and activated, it will supply the variation.</li>
	<li>Lacking the above alternatives, the manually entered "Assumed Magnetic variation", will be used for all calculations. See below.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<strong>Assumed Magnetic variation.</strong><br>
This value will be used if variation is not available through the GPS or the WMM plugin.<br>
The default value is 0°. As usual, positive values are also called 
"easterly variation" , and negative values are also described as 
"westerly variation".<br>
<strong>(+W,-E)</strong> this is just a reminder that  the program will 
reverse the signs you entered, as a conversion from "true" to "magnetc" 
course takes place.<br>

<strong>OpenCPN and over-zooming</strong><br>
It is very common that charts are based on surveys that are twice the 
scale of the charts natural scale. For example a chart in 1:50.000 would
 be based in a survey in 1:25.000.<br>
Once a vector chart is zoomed in to a factor 2, no more details can be 
found. OpenCPN  makes the navigator aware of this fact in a few 
different ways.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/overzoom.jpg" width="500"><br>
This screen-shot shows an example how over-zooming warning is treated.<br>
<strong>Overzoom Warning </strong>(default)<br>
At a zoom factor of 4 the embossed OverZoom warnings will be displayed 
in the NW part of the screen. From a factor 10 to 30 a blur or gentle 
bluish fog will be overlaid on the chart. This applies to vector charts 
and raster charts using the Mercator projection.<br>
<strong>Overzoom blur/fog effect</strong> (default)<br>
Overzoom blurring is performed only for those systems with modern and 
fully capable OpenGL drivers/cards. Otherwise, a very gentle "fog" is 
applied to extreme overzoom displays, as a visual que to the user that 
the chart is highly overzoomed.<br>
From a factor 10, lines and depth numbers on vector charts will be 
scaled and appear bigger, to further indicate the imprecision of chart 
feature geographical location at high over-zoom. This  imitates what 
happens with a raster chart, when the individual pixels gets bigger and 
bigger.<br>
<br>
Options - Make sure you understand all the implications of the following two options, before activating them.<br>
<strong>Suppress blur/fog effects on overzoom</strong><br>
The blurring or bluish fog, will be turned off.<br>
<strong>Suppress scaled vector charts on over-zoom</strong><br>
The scaling of lines and number will be turned off. Applies to vector charts only.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note that</strong> the blurring effect and scaled vector charts 
does not aply to single chart mode, so an alternative to this option is 
to toggle the "Q" hotkey.<br>
<br>
Below is how it looks like with both the above options activated.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/overzoom2.jpg" width="500"><br>
<br>
<strong>Course-Up Mode Display Update Period:</strong> This relates to 
how often the entire displayed chart is updated. The own-ship and AIS 
icons are still updated every second. The default value is 15 seconds. A
 "zero" value is allowed! The default mode is North-up. It's easy to 
switch between the two modes through the right-click menu.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chart Zoom/Scale Weighting</strong><br>
This option has a short description, on screen. Here are some further notes.<br>
The slider applies to zoom operation dynamics, not to static chart selection.<br>
The option really asks you this question.<br>
"On zooming in, when do we switch to a smaller scale chart if available?"<br>
Your answer may depend on your screen resolution and other preferences.<br>
The slider affects zoom-in operations most directly.<br>
-5...delay switching to smaller scale to improve performance and visibility.<br>
0....As OCPN always was, default<br>
+5...Switch sooner to a smaller scale chart, if you want more detail.<br>

<strong>Physical Screen Width</strong><br>
<strong>Auto</strong><br>
This is the default were OpenCPN will use the size that the operating 
system reports. Unfortunately this is not always correct, leading to an 
incorrect scale on screen for the charts.<br>

<br>
<strong>Graphics</strong><br>
<span><strong>Use Accelerated Graphics (OpenGL)</strong></span> The net 
effect of full OpenGL optimization on raster charts with compatible 
hardware is nothing short of amazing, especially with low-spec, 
low-power systems. Unfortunately the support for OpenGL on Windows is 
sometimes problematic. Intels OpenGL graphics drivers on Windows are 
very buggy, for example.  Read more on the <a href="#OpenGL"><em>OpenGL</em></a> page! <br>
If you hav started OpenCPN without OpenGL support, this option will be greyed out.<br>
<br>
<strong>Options</strong><br>
The standard Option dialog looks like this<br>
<br>
<img alt="Options-Display-Advanced-Opengl" src="images/5GL-non-expert.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
An expert version is available by adding a line to the opencpn.ini (opencpn.conf) file.<br>
 
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>[Settings]<br>

To turn the expert version off, change the value from "1" to "0", or delete the line.<br>
<br>
<quote><img alt="" src="images/4GL-expert.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<strong>Use Accelerated Panning</strong> works if your graphics card supports Frame Buffer Objects.<br>
<strong>Texture Compression</strong>  greatly improves the speed of 
raster chart display. It works by treating raster charts as compressed 
textures instead of bitmaps, and these textures are loaded and displayed
 much more efficiently by the graphics <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/hardware.html" title="View more discussions on Hardware">hardware</a>. They also consume much less GPU memory space.<br>
<strong>Texture Compression with Caching</strong> A further improvement 
to raster chart display loading and panning. This option uses the system
 hard drive to store pre-calculated raster chart compressed images in a 
way that is optimized for direct loading into the graphics card. When 
enabled, the texture cache is created dynamically, as charts are visited
 in normal navigation. Depending on the OpenGL hardware capabilities, 
there may be some slight, but noticeable, delay as a chart is accessed 
the very first time while the textures are created, compressed, and 
written to disk. Once a particular chart section has been cached, 
subsequent accesses are very fast. If the OpenGL hardware texture buffer
 is capable, then rendering on-screen is virtually instantaneous.<br>
* The cache understands color scheme changes. Cache entries are automatically created for each of the 4 possible <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/bsb.html" title="View more discussions on BSB">BSB</a> color schemes, as they are encountered in normal operation.<br>
* The cache understands chart Edition Dates. So, if one manually updates
 a chart (thus changing the chart's Edition Date), the old cache 
contents will be discarded, and a new cache will be built automatically 
as the new chart(s) are visited.<br>
* Using compressed texture caching retains all the benefits described 
earlier. It is very much faster on low spec hardware, at the expense of 
more disk space usage.<br>
* There is a command line option which will build/update your compressed
 texture cache. You may execute opencpn like this: opencpn 
/rebuild_gl_raster_cache (-rebuild_gl_raster_cache on linux)
<ul>
	<li>* "Texture Compression" and "Texture compression caching" may 
actually slow down some machines, depending on the capabilities of the 
video system.</li>
	<li>If you are using OpenGL on a low-spec machine, you will have better performance if you<br>
	a) disable texture caching, or<br>
	b) Pre-build the texture cache in a region of interest. That is, move 
the boat to say Dover. Then do Options-&gt;openGLOptions-&gt;Build 
Texture Cache. You do not need to wait the entire time, which may be 
hours for a large chart set. "Skip" out when the distance reported is 
100 miles or so.<br>
	Eventually, after steady use, your texture cache will be filled 
automatically in the background, and performance Show FPSwill increase 
steadily.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Size of the current "Texture Cache" </strong>appears just to the right of the button "Clear Texture Cache". In the picture above this value is 101.8 MB.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4fps.png" width="500&quot;">
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Show FPS</strong>  FPS stands for Frames Per Second, and 
is one way measure OpenGL performance. The number appears in the lower 
right hand corner of the display, to the right of "Scale". Above you see
 "26 fps". If you report a graphical problem, expect the devolopers to 
ask you about this figure.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Enable Transparent Toolbar.</strong> This option is greyd out in
 OpenGL mode, as the feature only works in traditional mode. On Linux it
 is necessary to activate a window manager compositing system, such as 
Compiz or GNOME Shell, to have a transparent toolbar.<br>

Kilometers<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4ShowRadarRings.png"><br>
<br>
<strong>Tracks</strong><br>
<strong>Automatic Daily Tracks</strong>.    <br>
Automatic Daily Tracking ensures that the track-points collected 
throughout a single day (midnight to midnight in local zone time) are 
stored and managed as a single (possibly multi-segment) track.<br>
If the Automatic Daily Tracking check-box is selected, the "Toggle 
Tracking" tool will - as before - turn tracking on and off. However, on 
turning it off, the accumulated track will be extended with the previous
 one, if it does not extend into yesterday. Disjoint segments are kept 
separate, time-adjacent segments are merged into a single segment.<br>
Disjointed track segments, can be joined through the right-click menu, when they are selected in the Route Managers Tracks Tab.<br>
Every Midnight the tracking is turned off and on again automatically, to ensure that the track does not span dates.<br>
If Automatic Daily Tracking is selected during the day, when some tracks
 have already been created, only the last one will be merged with future
 daily tracks.<br>
Assuming Automatic Daily Tracking is on, normally during tracking 
periods there will be two tracks visible in the Route Manager: the 
current track (red color track-points on the chart) and the previously 
accumulated track for the day. After toggling tracking off there will be
 just one track for this day.<br>
If the timezone needs to be changed, it is a good idea to close OpenCPN application before..<br>
With the manual capability of splitting and extending, the daily tracks can be easily managed at any time.<br>
The daily tracks will be automatically named with the date in the local Time Zone, but can of course be changed manually.<br>
The Automatic Daily Tracks follows the settings in <strong>Tracking Precision</strong>, see below.<br>
Without Automatic Daily Tracks selected, OpenCPN handles tracks as before.<br>
<br>
<strong>Highlight Tracks</strong>  shows a 7 to 10m wide highlighting, 
either side of the track. This is not selectable for individual tracks. 
The idea of the highlighting is to remind us that following a previous 
track exposes us to the inherent inaccuracy of GPS, and that the real 
track followed is most likely within the highlight region, but not 
necessarily in the middle. And this says nothing about the accuracy of 
the underlying cartography. For many charts it is prudent to assume at 
least 1.5 mm inaccuracy using the nominal scale of the chart. For a 
chart in scale 1:20,000 this translates to 30m.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/highlight.png" height="308" width="400"><br>
<br>
<strong>Tracking Precision</strong><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/options-Ships6.png" height="89" width="100"><br>
<br>
With track button in the ToolBar activated this setting affects the size
 of the data saved. It also affects the  "smoothness" of the track, 
though this is only visible when zoomed in to a very large scale.<br>
OpenCPN uses smart dynamic tracking, and only uses those track points 
that actually contributes anything to the track. A straight line track 
for example is only represented by it's endpoints. This is done by 
analyzing the track just behind the boat. The process is visible in real
 time, close to "ownship". The end result is good track accuracy while 
keeping the size small.<br>
Low: Good for offshore passages.<br>
Medium: Very good for all normal uses.<br>
High: Only necessary when very tight maneuvering needs documenting.<br>
<br>
<strong>Routes</strong><br>
<strong>Waypoint Arrival Circle Radius</strong>, gives an answer to this question.<br>
When following a  Route, with the autopilot engaged, at what distance 
from the upcoming waypoint should OpenCPN tell the autopilot to change 
to the next waypoint?<br>
The default is 0.05 nautical miles. This is equal to about 93 meters or 300 feet.<br>
The default setting does not fit all circumstances. A number of factors 
are involved, for example, the type of navigation, the waypoint 
selected, own ships turning radii and speed. Find what setting(s) suits 
your boat by testing.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Options-Ships-Ownship-Routes" src="images/Options-Ships-OwnShip-Routes.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
The arrival radius can also be set individually for each waypoint in the Waypoint Properties dialog.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Advance route waypoint on arrival only.</strong><br>
Routes are explained in <em><a href="#MarksandRoutes">Marks and Routes</a></em>. With an active route, the Dialog "This Leg" is visible near the upper right corner of the screen.<br>
This dialog contains "RNG", the <strong>"actual range"</strong>, or distance to the next waypoint.<br>
The <strong>"normal range"</strong> is different. It is the distance 
from ownship to a line which passes through the destination waypoint and
 is at right angles to the current route segment.<br>
The actual range is always equal to or greater than the normal range. 
When the difference is greater than 10% both values are shown in "RNG"<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4RNG.png"><br>
<em>The "normal" range is the second number shown. 1.88 in this case.</em><br>
<br>
When following a Route OpenCPN normally decides to advance to the next 
waypoint if at least one of the following two conditions apply.
<ol>
	<li>The "normal range" is less than the declared arrival radius.</li>
	<li>Ownship is moving away from the target waypoint, and has been for more than two seconds.</li>
</ol>
With <strong>Advance route waypoint on arrival only</strong>  activated, OpenCPN <strong>only</strong> advances the route to the next waypoint, if condition <strong>1</strong> above is true. Condition <strong>2</strong> is ignored.<br>
<br>
This feature is useful when sailing and you can't lay the next mark and 
are forced to tack a few times to reach it. It allows a ship to move 
away from waypoint without automatically advancing to next waypoint.<br>
This ensures that the next waypoint stays active until you either reach 
it, or you reach a line through it, which is perpendicular from the 
marked route. In the latter case you have a cross track error greater 
than the arrival radius.<br>
<br>
<strong>On the other hand....</strong><br>
Option 2 helps you if you really want to cut a corner by a large 
distance, in such a way that the "normal range" will never be less than 
{arrival radius}. We want to automatically advance the route in this 
case.<br>

<br>
Maritime Mobile Service Identifier (<strong>MMSI</strong>) is a number identifying a ship in communication. MMSI consists of nine digits. All VHF units using Digital Selective Call (<strong>DSC</strong>), are programmed with the vessels MMSI. The same applies for AIS and EPIRBs.<br>
<br>
MMSI numbers, individual targets, can be handled in a few, preset ways.<br>
Below we have set 970000099 as an MMSI that should be tracked as a MOB.<br>
The number could for example belong to a crew members Personal Locator Beacon.<br>
The "MMSI Properties" popup becomes available when right-clicking. 
Doubleclicking on the MMSI bypasses the popup an takes you directly to 
Properties edit dialog.<br>

<strong>Tracking</strong><br>
<strong>Default tracking</strong>: This is the normal tracking controlled by Options-&gt;Ships "OwnShip" and "AIS TArgets" tabs.<br>
<strong>Always track and Never track</strong>: The MMSI Properties 
dialog allows one to preset the tracking behavior of a particular MMSI 
target, even if the target is not presently visible. Always track a 
friend or a ship you are interested  in. Ignore that ferry that just 
clutters your screen. Just a few examples.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ignore this MMSI</strong>: The target will not show at all on the screen<br>
<br>
<strong>Handle this MMSI as SART/PLB MOB.</strong><br>
<em>With this setting a MOB from your ownship will be signalled immediately.</em><br>
Special Search and Rescue Transponders, SARTs, are now available, using 
the AIS system. Personal Locator Beacons transmitting on the AIS 
frequencies are also available.These are sometimes called Personal AIS 
MOB Devices. Don't confuse these with the more common personal EPIRB, 
that cannot be tracked by OpenCPN.<br>
Entering the the MMSI number makes it possible to  use these devices as 
an onboard emergency MOB tracking system. Setting off a device, alarms 
all vessels that can receive the signal, but it tells you that this 
emergeny is directly related to your vessel.<br>
OpenCPN will now treat this MMSI as a standard MOB. Read more <em><a href="#ManOverBoard">Man Over Board</a></em><br>

<strong>Convert AIVDM to AIVDO for this MMSI</strong><br>
AIVDM NMEA 0183 sentence -&gt; AIS position reports from other vessels<br>
AIVDO NMEA 0183 sentence  -&gt; AIS position reports from own vessel<br>
<br>
The setting is intended for at least the following very specific scenario:<br>
1. You have an AIS transponder, not connected to your computer.<br>
2. You have a separate AIS receiver, used to monitor your own AIS signal, as well as all other traffic.<br>
3. You desire not to collide with yourself, virtually. So you instruct O to convert the AIVDM<br>
for your MMSI coming in via your AIS receiver into AIVDO, or "ownship". 
Thus, no collision. O may, however, also use this converted AIVDO for 
ownship position if enabled in the connections dialog.<br>
There may be other uses for this VDM-&gt;VDO conversion.<br>

OpenCPN version 3.2 featured a complete redesign of the NMEA message 
handling structure, including a new GUI and monitor window. This feature
 has been further improved and tuned in version 4.0. The current scheme 
provides extensive NMEA management capabilities, including:<br>
-Input message filtering, by TALKER ID and/or message type.<br>
-Virtually unlimited input port multiplexing, with shared I/O and individual data rate settings.<br>
-Selective message echo capability, similar to third-party mux applications.<br>
-Programmable output port messages, for e.g. autopilot interfaces.<br>
-Full Network input and output, including TCP, UDP, and GPSD services.<br>
-GPSD client support for Windows platforms.<br>

<ul>
	<li>All this is different from the logic in earlier versions of 
OpenCPN. From version 3.2, there is no defined "autopilot" port. The 
autopilot is simply connected to any available output- enabled 
data-stream, and gets everything on the bus, subject to user specified 
output filtering. There is no specific  "shared" AIS and GPS port, as 
all ports are shared.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33OptionsConnections.png" width="600"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li>The key point to keep in mind with this new setup is the complete 
orthogonality between message sources, message destinations, and 
transport media. All messages come and go from an internal "bus", and 
all internal modules have access to all messages. Any message can be 
received, and possibly re-transmitted according to the configuration 
established. If the messages get onto the bus, OpenCPN will do the right
 thing. For example, if it is an AIS message, the AIS module will get 
the message and act accordingly. Plugins also get all messages.</li>
</ul>
 <img alt="" src="images/Connections.png" width="600">
<ul>
	<li>To get a taste of what can be done, we start with a lab scenario. 
In the screen-shot above, four Data Ports are enabled. GPSD on localhost
 port 2947, /dev/ttyUSB1 as ais port, next is an output port to a 
computer on the local network and last the San Fransisco AIS feed *. 
Note that the connections are automatically sorted in order of the 
priority setting  The picture is from a Linux computer, but the 
receiving box is an Win XP. Both boxes are configured to use the same 
broadcasting address 192.168.0.255 ** on the local network, using the 
default 10110 port. Note that UDP, and not TCP, is used. OpenCPN on the 
XP box receives and shows all info from the three first ports and even 
data from the VDR plugin, if it's running. All input sources are merged 
together and available to transmit to an external computer. Every 
computer on-board can be used as a repeater to the main box!</li>
	<li>Note that in this scenario  the UDP connection is output only.  In 
previous releases of OpenCPN all UDP data connections would read data as
 well as write.  This is a possible configuration in the current release
 but neither required nor generally desirable. If a broadcast connection
 is read/write, all data written will be read back leading to the 
potential for data loops.  To avoid this, the priority of any read/write
 broadcast connection should be set lower than that of any other 
interface on which OpenCPN receives data for re-distribution over that 
interface.   For most purposes setting a broadcast connection to <strong>either</strong> read <strong>or</strong> write is the preferable solution.</li>
</ul>
* The San Francisco AIS feed has now changed to ip address 76.103.90.196, also on port 9009.<br>
** There is no advantage with using a broadcast address on the local 
network with just a few computers. It's as easy to just specify the 
addresses of the receiving computers as outgoing connections on the 
transmitting computer. The "receivers" specify the "transmitter" as 
address for a connection.<br>
 
<ul>
	<li>In real life, <strong>a common setup</strong> will include input 
from GPS, AIS  and output to an Autopilot. If your GPS produces GPRMC, 
then this will be automatically shipped to the autopilot. Everything on 
the internal multiplex bus will be sent to the output port that the 
autopilot is connected to, even if a route is inactive. If, a route is 
active, OpenCPN will create and send NMEA (EC)RMC sentences to output 
data ports. The only reason OpenCPN "synthesize" an ECRMC sentence is to
 cover those odd cases when there is no other source of RMC in the 
system, and the Autopilot wants variation, SOG, etc. This might be the 
case if an older GPS produces GPGLL alone, for instance, which has no 
var.  There is no "new" information in the transmitted, synthesized 
ECRMC.</li>
	<li>The autopilot might be complaining that it is getting RMC 
information from two different talkers (GP and EC) at the same time, and
 cannot decide what to do. The easiest solution if don't like the ECRMC,
 is to filter it out of the output stream of the port  connected to the 
autopilot. Or choose a filter to allow only GPRMC and ECRMB for this 
port.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Filter NMEA Course and Speed Data:</strong> Providing a 
rolling average of COG/SOG, with configurable sampling period. This 
feature is useful, for example, if you find that course and speed from 
the gps is varying erratically due to the sea state. The Dashboard 
plugin is not affected by this setting  - COG and SOG are updated about 
once per second.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Debug_win.jpg" width="600"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Show NMEA Debug Window:</strong> If you check this box you 
will get a window that shows the NMEA data sentences coming into or 
going out from OpenCPN. In the picture above we can see the color-coding
 at work. Messages in red could occur as well, and indicates a transmit 
error. Connections Priority change messages, will also be printed to the
 NMEA Debug Window. The reason that AIVDM messages are both dropped and 
appear as  "Output message", is that there is more than one source for 
this message, and the filter just applies to one source.</li>
	<li>Have a look at the page<em> <a href="#NMEASentences">NMEA Sentences</a> </em>to
 see which messages are understood. OpenCPN generally does not care 
about the Talker ID, the first two letters in the message type. $GPGGA 
above, is the talker GP = the gps, sending a GGA = position message, for
 example. At the end of each sentence there is a "*" followed by a 
calculated checksum.</li>
	<li><strong>To see all messages</strong> it's important to close the 
Options dialog completely, while leaving the NMEA Debug window open. The
 ECAPB sentences etc, will not appear while the Connections dialog box 
is open as autopilot output is disabled during this time.</li>
	<li><em>Known issues</em>: The pause button only works if the main 
Options dialog is closed. In Linux, the debug window can only be closed 
by unticking the <strong>Show NMEA Debug Window </strong>box, unless the the main Options dialog is closed.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>If there are NMEA sentences in the debug  window, then OpenCPN has opened the port set in the<strong> Data Connections</strong>.
 Note that the source of each NMEA sentence is printed after the time 
stamp o each line. If your GPS port is configured, and there is  no 
"red" boat, then the only reasons are: no gps fix or wrong sentence 
configuration from the GPS.</li>
	<li>Messages originating from GPSD or the VDR (Voyage Data Recorder plugin) will also show up in the debug window.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li>For simple NMEA data stream debugging, add the following to your opencpn.ini file:Under [Settings] add a line</li>
</ul>
<em>     DebugNMEA=1500</em><br>
     This will provide up to 1500 debug messages pertaining to NMEA traffic to the <br>
      opencpn.log.<br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Format uploads for Furuno</strong> <strong>GP3X input</strong> <strong>filtering</strong>:
 If  the special Furuno gps protocol is needed, tick this box. The 
reason is that Furuno uses their own version of NMEA for uploading 
routes. Furuno GPS users take note. It is now allowed to use a numeric, 
two digit OpenCPN route name (e.g. 10, 21, etc).</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Use Garmin</strong> <strong>GRMN (Host) mode for uploads.</strong>
 Make sure that  this box is ticked, if you have a Garmin GPS. The 
reason for this is that Garmin units cannot accept route uploads via 
standard NMEA0183. This is a "design feature" of all Garmin receivers.</li>
	<li><strong>Use magnetic bearings in output sentence ECAPB</strong>. 
Some autopilots, among them Simrad, require navigational bearings, 
contained in the APB sentence, to be transmitted as Magnetic bearings 
rather than as True bearings, OpenCPNs default.</li>

higher priority stream appears. The present filter does not handle the

<h3 id="AddaNetworkConnection"><strong>Add a Network Connection</strong></h3>
<br>
<img alt="Options-Connections-Network" src="images/Options-Connections-Network_0.png"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: There are three choices of protocols TCP, UDP and GPSD.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>TCP:</strong> is a "connection-oriented" protocol which 
provides a reliable link between two network endpoints.  TCP ensures 
that any network packets lost in transit are re-transmitted.  Internet 
AIS servers normally accept TCP connections as do many 
serial-to-network/wifi devices.</li>
	<li>To make a connection to a remote TCP server, enter its IP address 
or hostname in the "Address" box and the TCP port on which the server 
listens in the "DataPort" box.  Many devices use a non-standard TCP port
 rather than OpenCPN's standard 10110, so do check the server's 
documentation.</li>
	<li>If "0.0.0.0" is entered in the "Address" box, OpenCPN will act as a
 TCP server accepting a connection from a remote TCP client.  OpenCPN 
will listen on all its host computer's network interfaces for TCP 
connections to the port specified in the "DataPort" field. There should 
normally be no reason to select a "DataPort" value other than the 
standard 10110 unless multiple servers are required: In the current 
implementation a single data connection can accept only one client.  If 
multiple clients wish to connect to OpenCPN, a dedicated data connection
 must be provided for each and each data connection must have a 
different DataPort.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>UDP</strong><strong>:</strong> is a method of transmitting 
data as simple "datagrams" without negotiating a connection between two 
endpoints.  It involves no detection and retransmission of data lost in 
the network.  Within a small home/boat network such data loss should not
 normally occur and in any case, NMEA data is generally updated by 
"talkers" on a regular basis.  Unlike TCP which involves a connection 
between two endpoints, UDP data may be received by many "listeners".</li>
	<li>An OpenCPN UDP data connection will listen for data destined for 
the specified DataPort on any system interface or the broadcast address 
of any connected network.  If you don't need to receive multicast data 
or transmit any data, you may enter "0.0.0.0" in the "Address" box if 
you are unsure of what to enter there. Alternatively you may specify the
 address on which you intend to receive data.  In both cases behavior 
will be the same.  If you wish to receive multicast data you must enter 
the multicast address to which those data are being sent or the system 
will not see them.  If you wish to transmit <em>any</em> data ("Output 
on this port" checked) you must put the address you wish to send data to
 in the "Address" box.  In all cases (transmit, receive or both) the 
DataPort must be specified. For more information about broadcast and 
multicast, see <a href="#broadcast">"Broadcast and Multicast"</a> below.</li>
	<li><strong>GPSD:</strong> is a Unix/Linux gps server, which means that
 several different applications can share one gps receiver. Linux users 
have the choice between using serial or GPSD connections for their gps 
input.</li>
	<li>Ubuntu users take note! If gpsd is installed - use it. If you 
prefer a serial connection, un-install gpsd. The reason is that gpsd 
starts automatically when,for example, an USB gps is connected. This 
will block the serial port that the gps communicates with( /dev/ttyUSB0 
in many cases), hence no separate serial connection to the gps is 
possible. So it's an either or situation.</li>
	<li>OpenCPN also has support for Windows clients. So a windows computer
 should be able to connect to GPSD running somewhere on a network 
(testing), as an alternative to an UDP connection, described earlier.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Address</strong>: The network address to connect to. In the
 example above we used the broadcast address for convenience, but 
specifying host to send to, and host to receive from, works as well.</li>
</ul>
 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Port</strong>: The port to connect to on the network 
address. The default port for UDP is 10110. Port 10110 is designated by 
IANA for "NMEA-0183 Navigational Data". There should not be any reason 
to change this port, but it is possible.  See below. The default port 
for GPSD is 2947. Do not change this!</li>

output connections, unless it's filtered there as well. If 
"LegacyInputCOMPortFilterBehaviour=0" then the message will not be 
placed on the internal multiplexer. This will only work for serial

<h3 id="BroadcastandMulticast"><a name="#Broadcast and Multicast">Broadcast and Multicast</a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>UDP data may be delivered to more than one system when sent to certain special addresses</li>
	<li>A "broadcast address" is listened to by all devices on a network.  
It is normally formed by taking the network address (the first part of 
the IP address common to all systems on your local network) and setting 
the last part (the number which is different for every computer) to a 
value represented by all "1"s in binary.  If all your devices' addresses
 start with "192.168.1", your network's broadcast address will likely be
 192.168.1.255 (255 is "11111111" in binary.  This is why IPv4 addresses
 written like this never contain numbers higher than 255.  Except for in
 the movie "The Net" and we don't talk about that).  If you specify an 
address ending with "255", OpenCPN assumes you mean a broadcast address.
  This is not always true but will result in desired behaviour in almost
 all cases.</li>
	<li>The special broadcast address "255.255.255.255" is also listened to
 by all devices. It should not normally be used to transmit data from 
OpenCPN.  Use your local network's broadcast address instead.</li>
	<li>A "multicast address" is listened to only by devices which wish to 
receive information on that address.  IPv4 addresses in the range 
224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 are multicast addresses.  If you specify a 
multicast address for a UDP data connection, OpenCPN will tell your 
computer to listen for datagrams on that address.</li>
	<li>More than one system may send data to broadcast or multicast addresses, so this is a "many to many" communications medium.</li>
	<li>You cannot use broadcast or multicast addresses with TCP.  TCP is a "one to one" connection.</li>
	<li>Devices must to some extent process all broadcast packets on the 
network whether they are interested in them or not.  Multicast packets 
are normally only seen by devices which have registered an interest in a
 particular multicast address.  Consequently multicast is more efficient
 than broadcast although this is usually of little consequence in a 
small network.  Despite being used by NMEA-over-IP protocols such as IEC
 61162-4 and the forthcoming NMEA OneNet,  NMEA-0183 over IP multicast 
is far less widely supported in marine applications than NMEA-0183 over 
IP broadcast.</li>
	<li>There is no multicast address mandated for NMEA-0183 data in this 
context although you should avoid those addresses used by other 
protocols.  When using multicast with OpenCPN it is suggested that an 
address be used in the range 239.192.0.0/14 specified by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2365">RFC 2365</a> as the "Organization Local Scope".  If in doubt, try 239.194.4.4.</li>
	<li>There is no mechanism in OpenCPN to specify the network interface 
through which multicast packets are sent or received.  This will be 
determined by your system.  In some cases it may be necessary to 
manually adjust your system's routing  table to ensure that the desired 
network interface is used.  Refer to your system's documentation if this
 proves necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>If you transmit UDP broadcast or multicast, then you should
 set the priority of the "real" NMEA input to something higher than the 
UDP stream</strong>. If not, prepare for problems. The reason is that if
 you are broadcasting, then you yourself will get the UDP message as 
well, which again will be retransmitted...... Obviously, it duplicates 
the "real" incoming data. Thus we get source priority flip-flop on each 
message, since they have the same priority. For example set the UDP 
priority to "0" and real incoming connection to "1" or higher. Multicast
 loopback is not disabled for consistency with broadcast behaviour.  
This means that priorities must be set as detailed above when 
transmitting over multicast, but multicast communication between 
multiple instances of OpenCPN on the same system remains possible.</li>
	<li>The firewalls on some systems (e.g. OpenSuSE linux) may block 
broadcast and multicast data that you wish to receive.  Refer to your 
system's documentation to determine how to allow such data to reach 
OpenCPN.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="SendingRoutesandWaypointstoaGPS">Sending Routes and Waypoints to a GPS</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The feature "<strong>Send to GPS</strong>", which appears in the right click menus for waypoints and routes and in the Route Manager, is <strong>not</strong>
 linked to connections. The upload port does not even need to appear in 
the Datastream connections list. Its a completely separate <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/concept.html" title="View more discussions on Concept">concept</a>.
 For this reason users must define a separate upload port, that is 
remembered by OpenCPN. The port can be changed by clicking the button in
 the Route Manager.</li>
	<li>NMEA provides no handshake protocol for Route and Waypoint upload. 
So, OpenCPN simply sends the Route/WP information out on the port, 
without having any way to know if there is actually a device connected 
to the port.</li>
	<li>The Garmin protocol does provide handshaking, so OpenCPN can be 
sure that the information is uploaded correctly. The Garmin protocol 
will fail if the device is not a Garmin.</li>
	<li>In the case of standard NMEA, the indication "Route successfully uploaded"<br>
	is not very meaningful. You can say that it just means that a port was found,<br>
	and writing to that port succeeded.</li>
	<li>In the case of "hockey puck" GPS receivers, they probably ignore 
Route and WP uploads, since there is nothing for them to do with this 
information anyway.</li>
	<li>The key to remember is that Route and Waypoint upload process is 
completely independent of normal running Datastream operation. They are 
two separate sub-systems.</li>
	<li>It does no harm to assign the Datastream GPS port as an output and 
input device together. Some users might reasonably expect that this 
would be required for Route and W/P uploads. Most GPS receivers would 
ignore input sentences other than Route and W/P uploads anyway.</li>

	<p>Note: Some autopilots, Robertson in particular, misinterpret

correct thing to do for the data in the same field. APA only differs 
from APB in this one field and APA leaves off the last two fields where 
this distinction is clearly spelled out. This will result in poor

<strong>GPS and low accuracy charts.</strong><br>
OpenCPN is checking loaded charts for accuracy as far as possible. If 
there is a problem with a chart, the chart info box that becomes visible
 when holding the cursor over the chart rectangle in the chart bar, will
 say " Warning: Chart georef accuracy is poor."<br>

The screen-dump below gives you a first feel for how AIS targets are presented and used in OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ais-alarm.jpg" width="700px"><br>
<br>
<em>The Lookahead mode is activated here and our own vessel is 
proceeding 352 deg at 13.8 kts, leaving an activated track behind, and 
projecting a dashed line ahead representing the course. This ends in a 
dot, that represents where we will be in 6 minutes, or 1.38 nautical 
miles ahead. We are meeting a vessel, steaming in the opposite direction
 following the traffic separation. This target also has a line and a dot
 in-front of it representing course and where it will be in 6 
minutes(user configurable), and a track behind it.. The two blue dots 
with a red/yellow line between them, represents where the vessels will 
be at CPA - closest point of approach, or when the are nearest each 
other, with present courses and speeds.</em><em> The meeting vessel is red, as it is a potential danger to us.</em> <em>An AIS target alert dialog has just popped up.</em><br>
<br>
There is a lot of information about the vessels that transmits AIS signals.<br>
 </p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/ais11.png" height="452" width="368"></p>

<p><br>
<em>The cursor is on top of the the meeting vessel on a SW course. As we
 have not yet received full information, this can take a while, we don't
 get the name but an id number, the so called MMSI number, instead. 
Exactly what is shown in the yellow pop-up is configured in the AIS tabs

 </p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/ais2.png" height="308" width="356"></p>

<p><em>This vessel is identified by name, and has a green color, as it does not represent any danger to our navigation.</em><br>
 </p>

<h3 id="AISTargetQuery">AIS Target Query<br>
 </h3>
<strong>What is an MMSI number?</strong><br>
Maritime Mobile Service Identifier (MMSI) is a number identifying a ship
 in communication. MMSI consists of nine digits. All VHF units using 
Digital Selective Call (DSC), are programmed with the vessels MMSI. The 
same applies for AIS and EPIRBs.<br>
<br>
<strong>What is an IMO Number</strong>?<br>
<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Maritime_Organization" title="International Maritime Organization">International Maritime Organization</a> (IMO) numbers</b>
 are a unique reference for ships and for registered ship owners and 
management companies. They were introduced under the SOLAS Convention to
 improve maritime safety and security and to reduce maritime fraud. For 
ships, the IMO number remains linked to the hull for its lifetime, 
regardless of a change in name, flag, or owner. ( from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO_numbers">Wikipedia )</a><br>
 
<p><img alt="" src="images/4Target-Query1.png"></p>

<p><em>If we instead of just hovering the cursor on an object, double 
click it, the  dialog above pops up. A lot of relevant information is 
displayed. CPA, "Closest Point of Approach", to ownship is 12.7 miles in

<h3 id="AidstoNavigationAtoN">Aids to Navigation AtoN</h3>

<p>More and more aids to navigation are equipped with an ais transmitter, and shows up as a target in OpenCPN like this<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Aton2.png"><br>
Note the word "Real", that says that this is an object that exists in reality.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33AtonOnPos.png"><br>
Here we have an AIS transmitter on a floating W Cardinal Mark.<br>
This is of course real and the buoy is on position. If the buoy is off position, for some reason, the Aton icon becomes red. <img alt="" src="images/aton_off.png" align="absMiddle" height="44" width="45"><br>
<br>
<br>
There are also Virtual AtoNs marked with their own icon <img alt="" src="images/aton_virt.png" align="absMiddle">.<br>
Virtual AtoNs are used to quickly make mariners aware of things like new
 wrecks, uncharted hazards and floating debris. They are normally used 
for a short duration until  replaced by real buoy, charted, removed or 
dispersed.<br>
<br>
Virtual AtoNs  are also used for information. An example...the position 
of the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordinating Center. Note the word 
"Virtual" in the dialog.<br>

<h3 id="TheAISTargetList">The AIS Target List</h3>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33AISlist2.jpg" width="700"><br>
Another way to present the AIS information. The AIS target list is available through the right click menu.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Sorting targets</strong><br>
Click on the header in a column to sort according to this criteria. For 
example, clicking "Range" sorts the targets with the nearest target on 
top. Click one more time to get the target, furthest away on top. There 
is an "autosort" checkbox. When checked, auto sort is on. May be 
unchecked/rechecked any time. The autosort checkbox is automatically 
unchecked when target count exceeds 1000. However... It may be rechecked
 directly by the user, even if the target count is exceeded, and will 
stay checked.<br>
Active Search And Rescue Target (<strong>SART</strong>) and Digital Selective Calling (<strong>DSC</strong>) distress targets, will always stay at the top of the list, even when sorting.<br>
<br>
AIS targets  with Lat &gt; +/-85 deg will show brg "unavailable". OpenCPN is not suited for Polar Navigation.<br>
<strong>Target Info</strong><em> </em>button<em>: </em>Click on a target to highlight it and then click the button  to display the information dialog.<br>
<strong>Center View</strong> button: Highlight a target an click this button and the screen will center on the target.<br>
<strong>Create WPT</strong>. Drop a waypoint at the current position of the target.<br>
<strong>Hide All Tracks</strong> If tracking is on in 
Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;Ais Targets, all tracks will disappear from the 
screen. Read more furher down this page.<br>
<strong>Show All Tracks</strong> Will reverse the previous option, and 
show all available tracks. If Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;Ais Targets is off, 
tracking will start for all targets.<br>
<strong>Toggle Tracks</strong><br>
<br>
<strong><em>Note the first column in the list "Trk". This indicates the current status of tracking for each target</em></strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong>AutoSort</strong> See "Sorting Targets" above, for an explanation of this box.<br>
<strong>Limit Range</strong>: The list will only show targets with a range less than, or equal to this value. <br>
<strong>Target Count:</strong> Total number of AIS targets.<br>
 
<h3 id="AIS Transponder and Ownship.">AIS Transponder and Ownship.</h3>

<p>OpenCPN does not show the ownship (i.e. AIVDO message) neither as an 
AIS target, nor in the target list. AIVDO is processed only in the main 
navigation thread. <br>
Earlier releases did show ownship, but this was a bug, simply an illusion.<br>
The earlier presence of AIVDO (ownship) information in the data stream, 
really only indicated  that the transponder was turned on and received 
GPS signals. The only true way to <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/monitor.html" title="View more discussions on Monitor">monitor</a> the output of a transponder, is with a separate AIS receiver.</p>

<h3 id="AISdataport"><strong>AIS data port</strong></h3>

<p>Select your AIS input port in the Connection Tab. The AIS button in 
the ToolBar, appears different according to the following conditions.<br>
  <img alt="" src="images/ais.png" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Alive. The default AIS button. This icon appears as soon as an AIS 
port is active in the tool-box. It is also the normal state with an AIS 
receiver working and with no targets of interest.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ais_alive_active.png" height="32" width="32">AIS
 Alive and Activity, a small green circle will illuminate in the lower 
right corner of the Ais buton. If there is at least one AIS message 
every 4 seconds, the light will remain illuminated.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ais_supressed.png" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Suppressed. This icon indicates only that target suppression is 
activated in the AIS tab in the ToolBox. Referring to the picture above 
there are two sort of suppression:<br>
* Suppress display of all moored/anchored targets, max speed specified in dialog.<br>
* Suppress Alerts for moored/anchored targets.<br>
This icon will be over-ridden with the AIS alarm button if an alarm is, 
or becomes, active according to the AIS tab alarms settings in the 
toolbox.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ais_alarm.png" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Alarm. A target exist that raises the alarm as defined in the AIS 
tab in the ToolBox. It is the three settings "CPA Calculations", that 
rules if and when an alarm is raised.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/ais_disabled.png" height="32" width="32">
 AIS Disabled. No targets, if available, are shown on the screen. This 
button toggles with the other buttons. For example, if the AIS alarm 
button is visible, click the button and it will change to the "AIS

<div><img alt="void(0)" src="images/Options-Ships-AisTargets.jpg" width="500"></div>

<p> </p>

<p>This tab controls the behavior of many thing in the 
AIS display. There are no "best" settings. It all depend on where you 
are, what kind of navigation you are into and what kind of vessel you 
are on. It is your responsibility to evaluate this.<br>
<br>
<strong>CPA calculation</strong>: Rules for when the Closest Point of 
Approach- CPA (when two vessels are nearest each other) and the Time For
 Closest Point of Approach (TCPA) is calculated, and when warnings are 
activated. <br>
There are three tick boxes, which can be activated with user set values.<br>
<br>
<strong>No CPA Calculation if target range is greater than (NMi)</strong><br>
If the vessel is far away it is less interesting to calculate CPA. In a 
busy waterway this could cut down on clutter and processing speed if a 
reasonable value is set.<br>
<strong>Warn if CPA is less than(NMI)</strong><br>
Similar arguments to No 1. This controls when a warning for minimum CPA 
distance is given. A warning can be both on the screen and a sound. The 
CPA is shown on the screen when a warning is active.<br>
<strong>..and TCPA is less than (min)</strong><br>
This Box can only be activated if the previous box is active. If the 
minimum CPA is far in the future, it's not so interesting. If it's hours
 away, both vessels have probably changed speed and course in the 
meantime. Set TCPA to a reasonable value value depending on 
circumstances. A lower value if negotiating a busy waterway. A higher 
value when offshore. Many factors plays a role here. If you need to get 
off watch crew up on deck for a manoeuvre, take this into account, for 
example. Do you find that you get to many useless alarms? Consider 
lowering this value and/or the CPA value.<br>
<br>
If a target is within the distance set in #1 and  without an active 
warning, theCPA can be shown anyway through right-clicking on the 
target.<br>

<strong>Mark Target as lost after (min)</strong><br>
Target is regarded as lost if no transmission are received for the

<br>
<strong>Display:</strong> If and how a vessels course and speed should be displayed and if stationary vessels should be on the screen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show target COG predictor arrow, length (min)</strong><br>
An arrow will be shown in front of the vessel representing it's COG 
(Course Over Ground). The length of this arrow and the dot at the end of
 it represents the calculated position in the number of minutes set 
here. Set easily calculated values. If a vessel approaches you doing 15 
kts and the time is set to 6 minutes, the dot will be 1.5 nautical miles
 ahead of the vessel.</p>

<h3 id="To track or not to track?"><strong>To track or not to track?</strong></h3>

<p>This choice below boils down to two basic scenarios.</p>

<ul>
	<li>All targets will be tracked, with the option of turning off tracks for selected targets.</li>
	<li>No targets will be tracked, with the option of starting to track selected targets</li>
</ul>

<div>There are more about tracks in the section  "AIS Target List" above.<br>
<strong><em>Note the first column in the Target list -&gt; "Trk". This indicates the current status of tracking for each target</em></strong>.</div>

<p><strong>Show target tracks, length (min)</strong><br>
This is the basic setting that can be refined in the "AIS Target list". 
With this box ticked targets are tracked even if they are not displayed.
 Start out with this option ticked, if you hesitate. Come back and 
fintune the settings later on, if necessary.</p>

<p>A track will be shown behind a target. This helps to judge the target vessels intentions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/trail.png"><br>
When this option is ticked, the context sensitive AIS menu changes to 
include the toggle option "Hide Target Track" / "Show Target Track".<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33HideTrack.png"><br>
<br>
When this option is <strong>not </strong>ticked, the context sensitive 
AIS menu changes to include the toggle option "Show Target Track" / 
"Hide Target Track". A big difference, in this case, is that OpenCPN has
 no record of the track. The tracking will start from the moment "Show 
Target Track"  is clicked.<br>
<br>
<strong>Hide anchored/moored targets, speed max (kn)</strong><br>
A target <img alt="" src="images/ais-moor.png" align="absMiddle" height="50" width="50">
  will not be displayed if the speed is less than the value set here. 
There are two exceptions to this rule, Aids to Navigation (Aton) and 
"Vessels Not Under Command". The rule is aimed at catching anchored or 
moored  vessels. The "Navigational Staus" is set by the ships and may 
not be correct.<br>
Be aware that the COG arrow will not be shown for any target with a COG 
less than this value, hence it's important to enter a very low value.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show Area Notices(from AIS binary messages).</strong> More about <a href="#AISAreaMessages"><em>AIS Area Messages</em></a> here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show AIS targets real size</strong>. Zooming in on a target will
 eventually show a rectangle using the real size , if available. The 
picture below also shows how differences in course and heading are 
treated.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/4Target-Real-Size.png" width="500&quot;"></p>

<strong>Treat WPL sentences as APRS position reports.</strong><br>
APRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System) is utilized by HAM radio 
operators around the world.The NMEA  WPL sentence is shorthand for for 
"waypoint location". If this box is ticked, a WPL sentence will be 
assumed to be an AIS-like APRS target.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rollover:</strong> Tick the boxes for the kind of information 
shown when hovering with the cursor over a target. This is what you get 
with all the settings  ticked.</p>

<strong>When exactly is an alarm activated?</strong></h3>

<p>An alert is set off if your boat is approaching the 
CPA, the blue dot on the extension of the course line, and the 
previously discussed set of conditions are met. Once the distance to the
 CPA increases, this happens when the involved vessels has passed each 
other, the alarm stops, even if the other conditions still apply.<br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>One user noticed an alert every few seconds, yet the target was still green.  The explanation is:<br>
			Variation between alert status and ship icon color is due to rapid 
changes in target course/speed. The target color can change from red to 
green while the alert dialog is showing. This may happen so fast that 
the red icon is not actually seen. OpenCPN does not automatically cancel
 the alert dialog in this case, in order to not mask information.</td>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><em>The US FCC has recently approved 
transmissions by AIS SART devices.  These devices were originally 
designed for SOLAS class ships as an alternative to radar SARTs for 
carriage on life boats, but the efficiency of design has encouraged 
applications down to man-over-board devices</em>. (<a href="http://www.exactearth.com/media-centre/exactblog/">www.exactearth.com/media-centre/exactblog</a>,<span><span>May 3, 2012</span></span>)<br>
<br>
Search And Rescue Transponders (SART) or PLB transmitting AIS messages 
are now available on the market. In an emergency situation the position 
 will be displayed as an AIS target in  OpenCPN. AIS SART can be a 
device on a vessel, in a life raft or a personal Man Over Board (MOB) 
device.<br>
<br>
<strong>If you and your crew have personal locator beacons, transmitting
 AIS emergency messages, and the MMSI number of each device is entered 
in Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;MMSI Properties-&gt;New, OpenCPN from version 
4.0, will automatically work as a man overboard tracking device.</strong><br>

The common thing is that the icon below marks an <strong>emergency</strong>.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/SART4.png" align="absMiddle" height="41" width="45"> SART icon, <strong>distress</strong> target display. <strong>This is a "Mayday".</strong><br>
<br>
On OpenCPN a distress signal sent by a  SART, triggers an visual alert 
and a warning sound, if this is activated in the ToolBox--&gt;AIS Tab.  <br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/SARTalarm.png" height="377" width="600"><br>
<br>
Once the alert is "Acknowledged", the target behaves as any other AIS 
target. In the picture below the cursor is over the target. The SART 
target will persist on screen for 18 minutes after the last transmission
 irrespective of other settings for AIS.<br>
<strong>SART alerts always have priority over DSC and CPA alerts.</strong><br>

And here is an AIS target query.<br>
<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><strong>To display the messages, tick the Options-&gt;Ships-&gt;AIS Targets-&gt;Show area notices(from AIS binary messages).</strong><br>
<br>
Many countries around the maritime world are testing the AIS binary messages. Expect a lot of development in this area.<br>
<br>
In OpenCPN, this is very much a work in progress, the areas were only added  April 2012 and the messages in December 2012.<br>
<br>
Areas and the messages included for each area, are available.<br>
In the US, Cape Cod is transmitting experimental Right Whale information. For testing, copy <a href="http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm">vislab-ccom.unh.edu/ais/notices.aivdm</a> into a text file and point the VDR (Voyage Data Recording) plugin to this file.<br>
These messages are updated quite often.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/area-query.jpg" height="480" width="700"><br>
<br>
The area messages are found as the first entries in a normal object 
query for vectorcharts. The easiest way to display this dialog  is to 
just double click in an area. The screen picture above shows that this 
works for RNC:s (raster charts) as well as ENC:s (vector charts). The 
first notice above is for the yellow tinted rectangular area while he 
second notice is for one of the circles outlined in green.<br>

<strong>An overview of available massages compiled by IALA.</strong><br>
IALA has agreed to maintain a collection of regional applications for

  <h1 id="MoreAboutTargetCPA" class="book-heading">More About Target CPA</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->OpenCPN displays warnings about 
targets CPA &amp; TCPA according to the setup in the AIS tab. But it's 
also possible to show CPA &amp; TCPA for any target, that is no 
immediate danger, but where internal CPA calculation is still done, to 
assist in the decision making.<br>
<br>
The AIS rollover window shows the CPA and TCPA of a target :<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/0.png" height="128" width="321"><br>
<br>
But it doesn't tell us <strong>where we and the target are at CPA</strong>, and if the target passes in front of us or behind us (i.e. should we speed up or slow down ?).<br>
<br>
See the following (real) example:<br>
We are sailing hard on the wind, while a vessel is approaching us, more 
or less from the wind direction. A CPA of 0.78 miles is normally safe, 
but there is this island in our way, meaning we had to tack towards the 
vessel, and it is still 14 minutes to go ...<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/2.png" height="551" width="750"><br>
<br>
What will happen with our CPA  after the tack ?<br>
Have we already passed each other or do we get closer when tacking just in front of the island ?<br>
The answer to these questions is a context sensitive menu for AIS targets. Move the<br>
mouse over the target, and when you see the CPA / TCPA info in the rollover window,<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/3.png" height="82" width="285"><br>
<br>
you can right click and select “Show AIS Target CPA”.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4.png" height="189" width="186"><br>
<br>
The function is only available when we have a “valid CPA”, i.e. when the rollover shows<br>
CPA and TCPA (it uses the internal CPA calculation).<br>
<br>
It simply shows the “CPA line” which is used in case of a CPA alert :<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/2.png" height="551" width="750"><br>
<br>
Showing the CPA-line as in the screen-shot above, makes life much easier. Nothing to worry about ...<br>
<br>
At CPA ...<br>
• we will be just in front of the island, exactly at our tacking position and<br>
• she'll already be behind us (CPA line points backwards from our CPA position)<br>
The CPA line is constantly updated, so you can follow the situation.<br>
<br>
This is, what it looked like directly after our tack<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/5.png" height="301" width="241"><br>
<br>
To get rid of the CPA line for a specific target, right-click on the target and select “Hide AIS Target CPA”.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/6.png" height="187" width="186"><br>
<br>
As already mentioned, the CPA line is shown only, when there is a valid CPA.<br>
A minute later, we don't have a CPA anymore for the target --&gt; the CPA line isn't drawn anymore !.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/7.png" height="274" width="354"><br>
<br>
Another example :<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/8.png" height="415" width="503"><br>
<br>
He'll pass behind us, so “full steam ahead !”<br>
<br>
<strong>Monitoring several targets</strong><br>
You can also monitor more than one target in parallel. Simply right-click on a second target and “Show AIS target CPA line”<br>
Situation could be :<br>
What happens to a second target if I get out of the way of the first one ?<br>

<strong>The Basic tab.</strong><br>
<strong>Name</strong>: Give the mark a suitable name. This will be visible on the chart, but can be hidden by un-ticking the <strong>Show Name</strong> box.<br>
<strong>Icon</strong>: Change the default icon for the mark. Only the "Name" will be displayed if selecting the "Empty" icon.<br>
<strong>The position of the mark</strong>: You can drag the mark with the mouse to the desired position or enter the correct <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> in these fields.<br>
Right clicking anywhere in the latitude or longitude display gives you 
the sub dialog shown above. Latitude and longitude can be copied 
separately or together. A copied lat/long will be available in the paste
 buffer, and will be displayed if you activate the "Jump to position..."
 dialog. It is also possible to paste a position. A Paste will try to be
 smart about parsing the format, and accepts a lot of different

the Internet or the the local computer.  These are either opened in the 
default browser or through the default application, for example for 
pictures or pdf files.<br>
For security reasons, the links does not work for launching other programs.<br>
<br>
Create a link by pressing <strong>Add</strong>. Give the link a good description in the new dialog.<br>
Enter an Internet address in <strong>URL</strong> or find a local file through the button <strong>Local File..</strong><br>

	<li><strong>Plan Speed</strong> The overall planned speed for the 
route. The speed for each leg can be set by going to the waypoint 
Properties-&gt;Description tab for the waypoint that starts the leg, and
 write in the speed. For example " VMG=9.7".<em> [Unfortunately this approach presently excludes writing descriptions for the waypoint. One or the other, be warned!</em>] The Plan Speed value is persistent and will be used for further routes, unless changed. The default value is 6.0 knots.</li>
	<li><strong>Departure Time</strong>:With no departure time the ETE

calculations.<br>
	To enter the present time, enter  "&gt;" (meaning: "Now") in the departure time box. <u>This works provided "Time shown as" -&gt; Local@PC</u>
  is selected. Press "Enter" and all the times in the "ETA" column will 
change. "&gt;" differs from entering the same time manually, say 
"5/23/2011 08:00":</li>

	<li><strong>Extend Route</strong>:Extending is possible only when it is
 obvious, what should be joined with the current route (current = 
visible in the Dialog). Eligible are all visible route points shared 
with, or lying nearby to the current route's endpoint. If there is 
exactly 1 such point, then it is considered obvious, and the Extend 
button is enabled. If there are more, some should be hidden before 
proceeding, until just 1 remains.<br>
	Routes are extended <em> forward</em>, based on the geographic 
location, next route point must be very near, as when mouse-extending 
the route. If the next route point is to far away for extending, just 
create the joining leg and extend twice.</li>
	<li><strong>Split Route:</strong>For splitting, the split point is 
selected as the row in the listing. The point-of-split becomes part of 
both new routes (shared) or tracks (cloned). Original route/track is 
deleted.</li>
	<li>Here is a basic example of first splitting then extending. The test route is shown below</li>
	<li><img alt="" src="images/orig.png" height="455" width="421">"Split Test_A"</li>
	<li>In the Route Managers property dialog for the route we have 
selected a waypoint where we would like to split the route. The "Split 
Test" Route now consists of two parts, that has been renamed.</li>
	<li><img alt="" src="images/orig1.png" height="359" width="600"></li>
	<li>Next we extend the first leg "Split Test_A" with the second leg 
"Split Test_B". This extended route s now named "Split Test_B_plus.</li>

	<li><strong>Reverse</strong>: Reverses a selected route. It's possble to cancel the reverse operation through a confirmation dialog.</li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Deletes selected route or track. Use the 
Shift key to mark multiple routes for deletion. This also work in the 
other Route manager tabs.</li>
	<li><strong>Export Route</strong>: Save the route on your computer for later use (import)</li>
	<li><strong>Send to GPS.</strong> Send the Route to your GPS. Pressing 
the button activates a dialog were an output port is selected. This port
 does not have to be listed in "Connections" as it is an independent 
feature. This choice also appears in the right click menu for routes and
 waypoints.  For <strong>Garmin Users</strong>, make sure that the 
ToolBox-&gt;GPS-&gt;"Use Garmin GRMN/GRMN(Host) mode for Waypoint and 
Route uploads" box is ticked. The reason for this is that Garmin units 
cannot accept route uploads via NMEA0183. This is a "design feature" of 
all Garmin receivers.</li>
	<li><img alt="" src="images/4SendtoGPS.png"></li>
	<li><strong>Delete All</strong>. Be careful. If you <strong>know</strong>
 you have saved the routes on your computer and are able to import the 
again, this is a simple way to clear the screen from routes. Better be 
safe than sorry, so save before deleting, if you want to be able to use 
the routes again.</li>
	<li><strong>Import</strong>. Import one or more previously saved 
Routes, or Routes from other gpx compatible applications. It is possible
 to select and import multiple routes. The default waypoint icon bitmap 
is a circle. This kicks in if the icon in the imported gpx-file is not 
recognized.</li>
	<li>Export All, now called "<strong>Export All Visible...</strong>"  Saves all visible routes, waypoints and layers, in one gpx file. This is done through a normal file saving dialog.</li>
	<li>If a Tidal Height Curve Dialog, for an individual tidal station is 
 shown on the screen, the tidal situation for this station will be 
tabulated along all route points in the route properties dialog. It is 
essential to enter a departure time and a planned speed. Once "Enter" is
 pressed the tidal column will show the nearest High or Low water 
considering the ETA at each waypoint.<br>
	  <img alt="" src="images/plan1.jpg" height="455" width="600"><br>
	  <img alt="" src="images/plan2.jpg" height="292" width="600"></li>
	<li>If no tide dialog for any station is open and a waypoints name 
contains the string @~~&lt;name&gt;, for example "@~~York Spit Light", 
then the tide report for the closest station with matching name is shown
 in the tide column for this waypoint. The most appropriate tidal 
station for each waypoint can thus be selected.</li>
	<li>When entering a departure time the ETA, Expected Time of Arrival will be shown, instead of ETE, Expected Time En-route.</li>
	<li>The individual waypoints "Description" field can contain the 
setting of planned speed specific just to the next route leg (e.g. 
"VMG=4.5;") and/or the specification of Estimated Time of Departure from
 this waypoint (e.g. " ETD=2/14/2011 12:00;"), allowing for planning 
extended stopovers. Time can be specified as UT, LMT or local zone time 
at the PC (default).<br>

	<li>Make sure that you have read all about Automatic Daily tracks and track Highlighting in the Documentation for the <a href="http://opencpn.org/toolbox_settings#auto-track"><em>Toolbox Settings</em></a></li>
	<li>The visibility of tracks is controlled by clicking the "eye" on each line. Tracks can be sorted by clicking the column headers.</li>
	<li>Tracks are extended <em>backward,</em> based on the time-stamp 
sequence, a track is selected, which ends as the latest one before the 
start of current track. Tracks are extended as a single segment if they 
share the extending point. If they ha no common point  a new "empty" 
segment, with no visible track, is added. Joining two tracks (i.e. 
extending a track) results in just  track one remaining. It may look 
like two tracks but the Route Manager treats it as a single track.</li>
	<li>"Merge Selected Tracks" is an alternative to "Extend Track", where 
tracks are joined. The difference is that Merged tracks are visibly 
joined by straight track-lines. Read on for instructions on merging 
tracks.</li>
	<li>If you have ever hit the Track icon by mistake, or closed down 
OpenCPN in the middle of a passage, you know that it's very frustrating 
it is, to have a voyage split up in a number of different tracks that 
does not come together.</li>
	<li>This can be fixed. Just select any number of tracks in the Track 
tab of the Route Manager window, right click the mouse to bring up the 
context menu, and choose to Merge Selected Tracks. The selected tracks 
will be merged in chronological order, with the track properties (name, 
color etc) of the resulting track keeping those of the earliest track in
 the selection.</li>

	<li>Layers are one or more routes, tracks or waypoints  that have been 
saved together in a gpx file. A layer is represented as a single gpx 
file. A layer is persistent and protected from changes. A waypoint in a 
gpx file for example, can be imported either as a "waypoint" or as a 
layer. The difference is that when imported as a layer it cannot be 
changed or deleted.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Layers are useful for many things. It can for example be used to 
update charts with new navigation marks and dangers as per Notices to 
Mariners, and to add Radio Call-In Points or to build a database of 
lights and locations, that will be visible on chart regardless of 
current scale. See the first picture above, where French and UK forecast
 areas are good examples of Layers. In the second picture, a very good 
celestial fix, plotted with a gpx script has been saved as a layer.</li>
	<li>More advanced uses could for example be an interactive cruising 
guide, using the possibility to embed links in waypoint descriptions.</li>

<h3 id="When is a feature a part of a Layer?">When is a feature a part of a Layer?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Layers are immutable, nothing can be changed. This could make them 
confusing, unless you are aware of the fact that they are .... layers!</li>
	<li>To see if a waypoint, route or track, is a part of a layer, 
right-click the object. If it is part of a layer, the context sensitive 
menu will say so. Alternatively, open properties and check the top of 
the dialog, if part of a layer, the layers name is printed. As 
always,double clicking on a object, directly brings up the properties

<h3 id="Handling Layers.">Handling Layers.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Layers can be created in OpenCPN,  and saved as a gpx file, or be created offline, manually or by scripts, for example.</li>
	<li>Layers that are saved in a directory called "layers", in the same 
place that holds your opencpn.ini(config) file, are automatically loaded
 on start of OpenCPN. These layers will be listed in the Route Managers 
Layers Tab on start up. The first time they will all be visible. Adjust 
visibility by clicking on the "eye" in the first column. This setting 
will be remembered. Have a look at the first picture on this page!</li>
	<li>The easiest way to find this directory is to go to the <img alt="" src="images/help.png" align="absMiddle" height="31" width="28"> - button in the ToolBar and look all the way down in the first tab (About).<br>
	In Linux create the directory: /home/$USER/.opencpn/layers.</li>

	<li>Any subdirectories in the layers directory,  are also loaded.</li>
	<li>Layers worth keeping, could be kept in the mentioned "layers" 
directory and  visibility during a session can be handled through "Hide 
from Chart" or "Show on Chart" buttons. New layers, gpx files, can 
easily be added in a subdirectory of it's own.</li>
	<li>A few restrictions apply to layer marks. A layer mark cannot be 
used to set anchor-watch on. If right-click-selecting co-located 
objects, priority is given to non-layer objects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="The Route Managers Layer Tab.">The Route Managers Layer Tab.</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Temporary layer</strong>: Any gpx file can be imported as a
 layer. This can be used for developing layers, or for import from a 
user defined directory with predefined layers, as necessary. Layers 
imported this way will be saved when closing down the computer, they are
 persistent. More permanent layers should be kept in the "layers" 
directory, as described above.</li>
	<li><strong>Delete: </strong>Unloads the layer, but doesn't of course 
touch the originally imported gpx file. A progress bar will appear when 
deleting large layers. It is not possible to stop the deletion, once 
started. For size restrictions, see below.</li>
	<li><strong>Hide from Chart</strong> or <strong>Show on Chart</strong> 
Controls if the marked layer is visible. The same thing can be achieved 
by clicking the "eye" to the left of the layers name. A red X across the
 eye marks a hidden layer. See picture above. These settings are 
persistent, they will be remembered after a restart.</li>
	<li><strong>Hide WPT Names</strong> Shows a visible layer without waypoint names. This helps to un-clutter layers, when zoomed out.</li>
	<li><strong>List contents </strong>or <strong>Delist Contents  </strong>Listing is this context means showing the individual points in the layer as waypoints in the "Waypoints Tab"</li>
	<li><strong>Import GPX..</strong> and <strong>Export All..</strong> <strong>Warning</strong>
 these buttons has nothing to do with Layers. They work as if you are in
 an other tab. For import use "Import New Layers". For export, create 
layers as described above.</li>
	<li><strong>Export All Visible</strong>.. exports all visible layers, 
routes and waypoints to a gpx file. Use this button to create new 
layers, for example. Just save the gpxfile in the right place, described
 above. Note that "visible" in this context is the opposite to a layer, 
route or waypoint being "hidden". This means that objects not visible on
 the screen, may be included.</li>
	<li>A progress bar will appear when exporting large layers. It is not 
possible to stop the deletion, once started. For size restrictions, see 
below.</li>
	<li>If a layer includes extended marks, linked to pictures, for 
example, the pictures will not be exported, only the links to the 
pictures. To "export" the whole layer to another computer, copy all the 
pictures separately. Adjust all the links in the gpx file, to the new 
computer, by doing a "search and replace" in a text editor on the new 
computer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Size Limits for the Layer feature.">Size Limits for the Layer feature.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>OpenCPN is  not suited to handle very large permanent layer files. 
Exporting and deleting such layers bogs down the program. With older 
hardware or limited available memory, even these recommendations may be 
to optimistic.</li>
	<li>OpenCPN 4.0 has refined the track and layer logic to improve performance with large tracks. See next paragraph.</li>
	<li>Newly developed static layers by <a href="http://argus.survice.com/argus_datadownload.asp">argus.survice.com</a>
 shows that OpenCPN has problems with very large layers consisting of 
waypoints named after the depth at the position. With 10,000 + 
posistions it's necessary to consider some rules when using OpenCPN. If 
you disregard these rules, expect bad performance.</li>
	<li>Deactivating OpenGL may improve the performance somewhat.</li>
	<li>Always load the files as a temporary layer, zoomed in on your local
 area. Never load when zoomed out. Why? Zoomed out OpenCPN has to handle
 all wpts at the same time when zooming/panning. Zoomed in it just a 
handful of wpts at the same time.</li>
	<li>An alternative is to load a file when zoomed in on an other area. 
This goes quick. Then promptly make the layer invisible. Only make the 
layer visible when zoomed in on the actual area.</li>
	<li>Never zoom out with these files loaded, unless you make the layer 
invisible first. There is no point in this anyway as all you will see is
 a lot of black "smear".</li>

  <h1 id="Great-circle Sailing" class="book-heading">Great-circle Sailing</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
Very few cruising boats needs to use Great-circles, but it's certainly 
an important consideration for commercial vessels across the North 
Atlantic and North Pacific. <br>
The advantage of a great circle is obvious, the shorter distance. The 
disadvantages, depending on latitude, could be quite a few. Colder 
weather, stronger winds, higher seas and perhaps even icebergs.  The 
great circle is just one factor in the decision making, when planning  a
 route, the weather is likely to be the deciding factor in most cases.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN has a builtin Great-circle tool as well as a Great-circle plugin.<br>
<br>
<strong>The built in </strong><strong>Great-circle tool.</strong><br>
The "Measure" tool in the right-click menu and the "Create Route" button
 on the ToolBar switches seamlessly to a great circle mode when asked to
 do long distance tasks. This mainly happens when using these tools in 
some east-west direction and far away from the equator. The mode kicks 
in when the difference between the normal, rhumb line and the great 
circle becomes larger than two nautical miles. This will be some 0.2% to
 0.5% of the total distance, depending on latitude and direction.  When 
this happens a clear curve towards the  pole will appear.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/pencil.png" alt="" height="45" width="45"><br>
The Measure Tool<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc7.png" alt="" height="206" width="500"><br>
<br>
Testing the measure tool for Manila to San Francisco (approximately). 
For a good illustration to Great-circles, find a second point that is 
opposite the first, on the other side of the globe, and just move around
 slightly.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc6.png" alt="" height="213" width="500"><br>
<br>
Once the first leg in measuring is done, it's plotted as a rhumb-line, 
to keep things simple. The active leg is still displayed as a 
Great-circle, if long enough. The distance displayed is the combined 
Great-circle distances.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/route.png" height="32" width="32"><br>
<br>
The "Create Route" Tool<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc1.png" alt="" height="220" width="450"><br>
<br>
If you answer no to the above question, OpenCPN will use a traditional 
rhumb line for the leg. Answering yes, will kick the Great-circle option
 into action and a number of intermediary waypoint points will be 
created. There will be at least 3 waypoints. The exact number of 
waypoints is calculated by OpenCPN and is appropriate for most cases.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/gc4.png" alt="" height="117" width="450"><br>
<br>
The created route is now available in the RouteManager dialog, as a normal route.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/gc8.png" height="152" width="500"><br>
<br>
As a real example let us looka at a route from Mossel Baai South Africa,
 to the western entrance to Investigator Strait South Australia. The 
Rhumbline is 5660 mautilcal miles, and the Great-circle, as approximated
 by the created route is 5249 miles. The "real" Great-circle is som 15 
miles shorter.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Composite Saling</strong><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/composite.png" height="147" width="500"><br>
<br>
Composite sailing is a Great-circle sailing with a maximum allowed 
latitude. OpenCPN has no such built option, but it's easy to create. <br>
Above is the same route as before designed for composite sailing, not going further south than 45<span>° S latitude. Start a route at Mossel Baai extend it until 45</span><span>° S becomes a tangent to the visible Great-circle. End the route.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/composite1.png" height="204" width="500"><br>
<br>
Do the same thing, starting with the destination and going backwards. Create a rhumbline route, using the two point along 45</span><span>° S.</span> The three routes together is the composite route. The total distance of the composite route is 5293 Nautical Miles.<br>

<h3 id="RoutePlugin"><strong>Route Plugin</strong></h3>
<br>
"Salty Paws" route plugin handles much more than Great circles, introduced here.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/route_plugin.png" alt="" height="415" width="500"><br>
<br>
The plugin have a few features not present in the built-in tool. It can 
calculate a composite route, and the distance between the waypoints can 
be set by the user. The end result, however, is a "gpx" file that is 
exported, and then imported into OpenCPN via the Route Manager.<br>

How to use split and extend - an example.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt.png" alt="" height="284" width="600"><br>
<br>
Hm...a bit of a miss in the planning. An islet with a shallow bank 
extending southward on our route. We put two marks north of the 
obstruction and would like to include these in our route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt1.png" alt="" height="438" width="600"><br>
<br>
The waypoint west of the islet is #2. We mark this in "Route 
Properties", from the right-click menu. The Button "Split Route" is 
highlighted, meaning it is available to use. This is exactly what we 
want to do, so we click the button and split the route at wpt #2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt2.png" alt="" height="245" width="600"><br>
<br>
Right click at #2 and choose "Append Waypoint",<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt3.png" alt="" height="429" width="600"><br>
<br>
Move the cursor to the first triangle, and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Then move the cursor to the second triangle , and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Same thing for the original wpt to the east of the islet.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt4.png" alt="" height="114" width="600"><br>
<br>
Click "Activate Route" to see that this extension worked.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt5.png" alt="" height="435" width="600"><br>
<br>
Once again mark  "Route Properties" in the right-click dialog. #3 is the
 last wpt in our "new" temporary route. The "Extend Route" button is 
highlighted, so we click it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt6.png" alt="" height="361" width="600"><br>
<br>
Open the Route Manager to view the result. Notice the naming of the 
routes. _B_plus is active. What remains is to delete route _B and to 
rename _B_plus to a suitable name, for example the name of your original
 route.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt7.jpg" alt="" height="172" width="600"><br>
<br>
Deleting route _B.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/incwpt8.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
And here is the finally adjusted route.<br>
<br>
This was just an exercise.....in real life, it would be easier to just 
move the existing waypoints in the route, to avoid the Islet.<br>

  <h1 id="WeatherRouting" class="book-heading">Weather Routing</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><p>Users have the choice between using qtVlm or the <em><a href="#WeatherRoutingPlugin">Weather Routing Plugin</a></em>. qtVlm is probably the more mature and stable choice and is described here.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN can import optimized routes from the Free and OpenSource QtVlm 
program. Make yourself familiar with QtVlm if you intend to use it, as 
many things are done differently from OpenCPN.</p>
QtVlm <a href="http://wiki.virtual-loup-de-mer.org/index.php/QtVlm/en">Documentation and Installation</a> <br>
QtVlm <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f121/free-routing-software-74738.html">Thread on OpenCpn Cruiser's Forum</a><br>
OpenCPN and QtVlm Summary of Route Transfer, see below<br>
<br>
<br>
Before going any further, make sure you really <strong>understand grib files</strong>, what they are and their limitations. A good place to start is <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Using-Gribs-And-Other-Objective-Forecasts">Franks Singletons pages.</a><br>
<br>
Let's look at an example of importing an optimized route from QtVlm. 
It's a situation most of us try to avoid. Going across the Bay of Biscay
 with an active Atlantic Low just west of the British Isles.<br>
The busy, time constrained, delivery skipper intend to find the best 
route from Lizard Point to Cape Finisterre. He has entered into QtVlm, 
the constraint, to route away from more than 30 kts headwinds. Below is 
the QtVlm optimized route based on the latest available grib file. Note 
that QtVlm doesn't know anything about tidal streams, currents local 
squalls nor about the state of the crew etc. These are more reasons why 
the final route always is the responsibility of the skipper.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Routing1.jpg" height="590" width="600"><br>
<br>
Right-click on the route and export in the kml format.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Routing2.png" height="335" width="500"><br>
<br>
Open OpenCPN. Right-click and "Paste Route"<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Routing3.png" height="487" width="500"><br>
<br>
This looks a bit ugly, and both the route and all waypoint have been exported.<br>
We want somthing better!<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Routing5.png" height="516" width="600"><br>
<br>
One alternative is to let QtVlm (Edit Route) "Simplify" the route before copying.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/routing6.png" height="731" width="600"><br>
<br>
 Another alternative is to first use the "Paste Track" option.<br>
<br>
*Note that this is no true track, it's just another way of exporting a 
route, possible due to the KML format. A track describes where we have 
been in the past, while routing is planning for the future. Importing 
the track gives a "light-weight" overview of the suggested route. Read 
more about the <a href="#GribWeatherPlugin"><em>Grib Weather Plugin</em></a><em>.</em><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Routing7.png"><br>
<br>
Next open OpenCPNs Route Manager Track Tab and press "Route from Track".<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Routing8.png" height="638" width="600"><br>
<br>
Much better. We now have a track with a route on top. Right-click and delete the track.<br>
Next, it is smart to display the same gribfile, used by QtVlm, in OpenCPN, using the Grib Plugin.<br>
<br>
All this looks impressive, but it's still based on a grib file. So it's 
still based on a computer prognosis, with no human input. All other 
reservations connected with gribs, still applies. An on board calibrated
 barometer is a good way to check what confidence can put on a grib 
forecast. Read more about the  <a href="#GribWeatherPlugin"><em>Grib Weather Plugin</em></a><br>
A reasonable polar diagram is essential as well. Producing one is 
standard procedure on racing boats, but not that common on cruising 
boats. Cruising specific factors, such as "comfort" also plays a part in
 a cruisers true performance capabilities.<br>

	<li>A rotating backup of navobejcts is automatically created on every 
program run. OpenCPN keeps backups of the last 5 runs. This can be 
changed.</li>
	<li>In the opencpn.ini/opencpn.config file you can find a configuration
 setting to control the number of backups kept, defaulting to <b>KeepNavobjBackups=5. </b>This value can be changed using a text editor.</li>
	<li>The backups are then stored in files navobj.xml.[1..x] (in the same
 directory as the ini file) where .1 is always the newest backup and the
 oldest is removed on the next program run. The file that will be loaded
 on next start is called navobj.xml.</li>
	<li>The backups are only rotated if the <span>navobj</span>.xml
 file has changed since the last backup was created. This prevents 
overwriting good backups with a broken version, more than once.</li>
	<li>Note that the navobj.xml files reside in a folder that is hidden by default by Windows. More information <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/installing_opencpn#log-config">is available here</a>.</li>

the file into OpenCPN.</li>
	<li>Each tab in the Route Manager (except the Layer Tab)  has a button 
"Export......". Use this to export one Waypoint, one Route or one Track 
at a time. Multiple selection is not possible in this version OpenCPN 
but will be implemented in the next version.</li>
	<li><strong>Create a layer</strong>, a collection of waypoints, routes 
and tracks by making the features to be included in the layer visible. 
Everything else should be deleted or hidden.  Every object that is 
visible on the screen when maximum zoomed out, will be included, not 
just what is visible on the screen for the moment. When you are ready, 
use the "Export all visible" button to create the layer gpx file.</li>
	<li>To <strong>Change an existing Layer</strong>, start with creating a
 backup of the existing gpx file, containing the layer, by copying it to
 a safe place. Make sure that no navigational objects are visible, that 
you don't want in the new version of the layer. Then use the Route

<strong>S57 Vector Charts and the CM93 ver2 charts.</strong><br>
All charts display the Dawn/Dusk and Night levels. This means that there
 is no change when the button is first pressed, but further pressing 
brings up a Dusk and then a Night palette.<br>
<strong>US Raster Charts</strong><br>
These are generally coded with all the levels. The Daylight level has slightly sharper colors for better daylight viewing.<br>
<strong>Other Raster Charts</strong><br>
Most other raster charts just contains a standard palette, and pressing 
the Button has no effect other than dimming part of OpenCPN, except for 
the chart display.<br>
The Brazilian Raster Charts includes a dusk and night palette, but the colors displayed is not what one would expect.<br>
Charts converted with the help of tiff2bsb or imgkap, normally only contains the default color scheme.<br>

nearb<em>y.</em>

<p><img alt="" src="images/anch.png" height="354" width="400"></p>
This feature can be used in other situations than just anchoring, but 
keeping an eye on your anchor, and making sure it isn't dragging, is the
 main purpose.<br>
<br>
<strong>Basic usage</strong><br>
<br>
To learn how it works let's make a dry run to a nice trade wind anchorage.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch2.png" height="399" width="400"></div>
<br>
After circling around and exploring the bay, we know where we want to drop our anchor.<br>
At  the chosen spot we drop the anchor, at the same time we right click on the "Own Boat Icon" and press "drop Mark Here".<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch3.png" height="393" width="400"></div>
<br>
The wind, ENE at 15 kts let us drift back until we are satisfied with 
our scope. A burst in reverse convinces us that the anchor is set, later
 confirmed by a leisurely snorkeling over the anchor. Time to sort out 
the anchor watch<br>
 
<div> </div>
<br>
Right click on the mark and press "Set Anchor Watch". The name of the 
mark changes to 50, and a green circle appears with a radius of 50 
meters.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch4.png" height="404" width="400"></div>
<br>
The anchor watch is now active, with a default max distance of 50m from 
the mark, and an alarm will be set off if the boat for some reason exits
 the circle. If "Play sound on CPA/TCPA Alerts" is set in the AIS 
ToolBox Tab, the same audio alarm is activated together with the visual 
alarm on the screen. To deactivate the anchor watch, right click on the 
mark and select "Clear Anchor Watch".<br>
<br>
If you are more than 50 m from the anchor when activating the watch this happens..<br>
<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch8.png" height="400" width="400"></div>
<br>
Sort this out by open the Mark/WP Properties Dialog.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch9.png" height="560" width="326"></div>
<br>
Change the name from "50 m" to a name that is relevant to the amount of 
chain and/or rode that you use, for example "75". Change the icon to, if
 you like. Pressing OK should stop the alarm.<br>
<br>
To get protection from the wind and a bit of northerly swell, we have 
really anchored to close to the beach. To keep an eye on this potential 
danger we set another mark on the beach.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch5.png" height="404" width="400"></div>
<br>
This time we change the "Mark Name" to -150, this means that if the boat
 comes within 150 meters of this mark, the alarm is set off. Green 
circle, OK to be inside. Red circle OK to be outside.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/Anch6.png" height="399" width="400"></div>
<br>
An hour later, after a heavy squall passed, the wind goes light and 
fluky. The boat drifts towards the beach and the anchor alarm sounds and
 comes up on our computer screen.<br>
The alarm sound is the same as the AIS warning sound and is set in the ToolBox under the AIS tab.<br>
<br>
<strong>Alternatives and Settings</strong><br>
A mark at the position of ownship, can also be created by hitting 
"Enter" or "Spacebar". "Ctrl + M" creates a mark at the position of the 
cursor. The anchor watch can now be set as demonstrated above with the 
default alarm distance being applied.<br>
<br>
A way to easily drop a mark, exactly at your current position, is to hit
 "Ctrl + Space". This is the "Man Over Board" shortcut. Right click and 
go to properties. Change the name to a suitable alarm distance and pick a
 different icon. Set the Anchor Watch.<br>
 
<div><img alt="" src="images/aa-mob.png" height="260" width="300"></div>

<div><br>
The picture is an illustration to what happens if you use the MOB 
keystroke, and then just activate the Anchor Watch. As the mark is 
already named, the default watch distance doesn't work. The green circle
 is the 5 m default minimum distance. The alarm goes off, of course.<br>
 </div>

<ul>
	<li>The Anchor Watch only works with an active gps. If the gps signal is lost, the alarm will be set off.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Both the default Anchor Watch Radius and Max distance  from mark can be 
changed by editing the configuration file, opencpn.ini on Windows and 
opencpn.config on Linux.<br>
Close down OpenCPN and open the configuration file in a text editor.<br>
Find the section that starts with "[Settings] ".<br>
Create two new lines, looking, for example like this.<br>
AnchorWatchDefault=45        (default is 50 m)<br>
AnchorWatchMax=2500         (default is 1852 m)<br>
Enter your own preferences, 45 &amp; 2500 are just for illustration.<br>
<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --> <br>
Automatic Anchor Mark.  This is what it does:<br>
If the following are ALL true:<br>
1. In "Cruising" mode, meaning that speed has at some point exceeded 3.0 kts.<br>
2. Current speed is less than 0.5 kts.<br>
3. OpenCPN has been up at least 30 minutes<br>
4. OpenCPN is exiting normally<br>
5. There is no anchor watch set on an "anchor..." icon mark.<br>
6. Any "Anchorage - icon" waypoint within 0.25 NM of current GPS location is deleted.<br>
<br>
Then, OpenCPN will drop a waypoint at the current location, with the name - "Anchorage created on [Date Stamp]".<br>
<br>
Thus waypoints are automatically created for known good anchorages as you shut down the computer. <br>
The 0.25 NM condition prevents clogging up frequently visited anchorages with closely spaced waypoints.  <br>
The other conditions help to prevent spurious waypoints. <br>
<br>
<br>
To use this feature find opencpn.conf or opencpn.ini as it is called in windows.<br>
Search for a line like this:<br>
AutoAnchorDrop=0<br>
and change the value from "0" to "1".<br>

  <h1 id="CM93 Offsets" class="book-heading">CM93 Offsets</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_lector"><strong>Caveat lector</strong></a><br>
There is absolutely no guarantee that a correction, based on one point, 
 as described below, will be valid for the whole chart cell. Be very  
careful when using this feature.<br>
<br>
Starting with offsets.
<ul>
    <li>Go to single chart (i.e. non-quilted) mode, with cm93 charts displayed. Use F9 to flip quilting on and off</li>
    <li>Zoom/Pan to the region of interest.</li>
    <li>Right click and activate "CM93 Offset Dialog"</li>
</ul>
  <img src="images/cm93.png" alt="" border="20" height="304" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="294"><br>
<ul>
    <li>In the list of cells/MCOVR IDs, selected the one MCOVR of 
interest.    The coverage area for this MCOVR object will be outlined 
with a heavy  yellow border.</li>
    <img alt="" src="images/offsets2.jpg" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
    <br>
    <li>Some cells have built in corrections already applied. The values
 wgsox and wgsoy, are offsets to bring the original chart cell to WGS84.
 See the first and third cell in the picture above. The values are for 
information only, and cannot be changed. These corrections are generally
 correct, but not always. Sometimes the corrections are wrong and 
sometimes there are no corrections where there ought to be. This is 
where this manual offset feature comes in handy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In order to use this feature effectively, one needs a geographically  
known reference point.  As an example, say there is a NAVAID present on 
 the chart  cell with known WGS84 lat &amp; long, as from a light list. 
 In this case, one  can drop a waypoint on the chart, edit the waypoint 
properties to the  known lat/lon, and then use the CM93 Offset Dialog to
 slew the  cell/MCOVR so that the dropped waypoint coincides with the 
NAVAID  feature on the cm93 cell (chart).<br>
<br>
You may also use a geographical feature such as a Cape or point whose  
location is absolutely known, as by reference to observation, or by  
rendering on another, more accurate chart such as a trusted scanned  
raster chart or georeferenced photo chart.<br>
<br>
To see how this feature works, here is an example from the South Pacific.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/offsets4.jpg" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
This is Tongareva, also called Penhryn atoll. A mark, with a triangle is dropped at the westernmost point of the Island.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/offsets5.jpg" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Zooming
 out to next smaller scale chart makes the triangle mark jump NNE. Time 
for some corrections, as we, at least for the purpose of this example, 
are confident that the larger scale chart is correct.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/offsets6.jpg" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Quite large corrections brings the chart into reasonable agreement.  <br>
<ul>
    <li>Use the spin controls on the right side of the dialog to adjust 
the desired user offsets. It is also possible to write numbers directly.
 Notice that positive corrections is towards North and East.</li>
    <li>In some cases it is not clear exactly which M_COVR ID that 
represents your position. A simple test will reveal if a mark reacts to 
(large) corrections.</li>
    <li>The offsets are automatically saved in the binary MCOVR cache files found in the program data directory as CM93/...</li>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The core OpenCPN tries to keep 
features to a minimum so that it is lean, mean and easy to use. Features
 can still be added through the plugin infrastructure.<br>
<br>
The number of plugins has increased considerably since the release of 3.2.2.<br>
All plugins are backward compatible meaning that new versions of OpenCPN
 works with old plugins. New plugins, however, will probably not work 
with old versions of OpenCPN.<br>

<h3 id="DownloadPlugins">Download Plugins</h3>
Go to the dedicated page for downloading plugins: <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/downloadplugins">PlugIns</a><br>
Currently there are about 20 different plugins available for download.<br>
For a complete list of plugins read the <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/plugin-threads-list-100306.html#post1189427"><u>recent posts in this forum thread</u></a><br>
 
<h3 id="PluginVersions">Plugin Versions</h3>
OpenCPN plugin interface is regularly updated with new features. New 
plugins are constantly developed and old plugins acquires new features.<br>
<strong>PlugIns are designed to be backward compatible; </strong>this 
means that, any old PlugIn should (must) work correctly with any more 
recent OpenCPN main program (not need to update your plugins when 
updating OpenCPN to a new version); BUT  <strong>using old versions of OpenCPN with a new or updated plugins</strong>, will not work.<br>
For example, don't expect Weather Routing, Climatology  or WeatherFax to work with OpenCPN version 3.0.<br>
 
<h3 id="BlacklistedPlugins">Blacklisted Plugins</h3>
Plugins or versions of plugins known to be problematic can be Blacklisted.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Blacklist.png"><br>
A dialog pops up for 5 seconds when starting OpenCPN, if a blacklisted 
plugin is detected. This will happen even if the plugin is not enabled. A
 number of plugins are blacklisted. They are, mainly, old problematic 
versions of plugins. There is always a newer version of a blacklisted 
plugin, or, in worst case scenario, one will soon be released.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<h3 id="InstallingaPlugin">Installing a Plugin</h3>
For<strong> Linux</strong>, place the downloaded "pluginxx.so" in 
{prefix}/lib/opencpn, which means /usr/lib/opencpn for a standard 
installation, using the provided packages. If you are compiling yourself
 {prefix} may be "/usr/local" instead of "/usr". Check "opencpn.log" if 
necessary.<br>
For <strong>Windows</strong> place the downloaded "pluginxx.dll" in a 
"plugins" sub folder of your OpenCPN installation folder. A common 
location is C:\Program Files\OpenCPN\plugins.<br>
Once the plugin is in the right directory, restart OpenCPN and proceed to enabling the plugin.<br>
For <strong>Mac </strong>right-click your app in Finder and open "Contents", and put your plugin in the "PlugIns" directory.<br>
 
<h3 id="EnablingaPlugin">Enabling a Plugin</h3>
Plugins are made available by clicking on the plugin in the 
Options-&gt;Plugin Tab. Once this is done, an "Enable" button appears. 
Pressing this button activates the plugin icon in the ToolBar and 
changes the the default "grayed out" text to black in the list. Not all 
plugins have an icon when active. For most plugins there is a 
"Preferences" Button for configuration.<br>
When a plugin is disabled in the Options-&gt;Plugin tab, the plugin Icon disappears from the ToolBar.<br>
The Plugin Icon works as a toggle switch for the plugin. Pressing the 
Grib Icon, for example, activates the Grib plugin. Pressing one more 
time, kills it.<br>
The WMM Icon uses a new feature, by displaying the magnetic variation, at the position of OwnShip in the button itself.<br>
<br>

<h3 id="ProblemswithPlugins">Problems with Plugins</h3>
If you run into problems with plugins, first check what the opencpn.log file say.<br>
For each plugin you will find lines similar to:
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">

<strong>The Dashboard plugin is always distributed with OpenCPN, no separate download is required.</strong><br>
<br>
If the data is available to OpenCPN in the NMEA0183 data stream the 
different instruments will display relevant data; but the plugin don't 
tell what is available. It is assumed that the user know what is 
connected. It is of course possible to activate all instruments and see 
what works.<br>
<br>
The Dashboard in action, two Dashboards, one vertical and one horizontal.<br>
Grab the top Caption bar with the cursor and drag the Dashboard as far 
as possible to the right or left. Let go the cursor, and the Dashboard 
will dock, the chart display will adjust, no part of the chart will be 
hidden. Horizontal Dashboards can in a similar way be docked top or 
bottom.<br>
This process is reversible. Just grab the Dashboard dialog bar with the 
cursor, an pull towards the middle of the screen, and the Dashboard will
 become floating.<br>
<br>

<br>
The same Dashboards docked left and bottom.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/dashboard-docked32.jpg" height="480" width="600"><br>
<br>
There is a grab handle in the SE corner of each Dashboard. Use it to resize each dialog.<br>
The graphics will change size, but not the text, which is handled separately. See further down.<br>

<br>
Once the Dashboard plugin is activated in the plugin tab, the Dashboard 
Icon will be available in the ToolBar and will work as an on/off toggle.
 The Preference button works exactly the same as described under 
"Dashboard Settings" below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/dashboard-plugin32.png" height="682" width="600"><br>
<br>
The "Enable" Button  activates the plugin and shows the icon in the ToolBar.<br>
Once enabled, the "Disable" Button is displayed, as show above.<br>
If you press the "Preference" Button the Dashboard preferences dialog becomes available.<br>

Right click anywhere in a Dashboard and a few options are displayed, in a small dialog.<br>
Above we have clicked on the vertical Dashboard. Make this Dashboard 
horizontal by clicking the "Horizontal" radio button. Stop displaying it
 by un-ticking the box in front of the first "Dashboard" line. Get it 
back by right clicking on the other Dashboard and tick the same box 
again.<br>

The Icons in the narrow pane to the left, represents the available 
instances. Click on an instance and the configured instruments shows in 
the "Instruments" pane.<br>
<br>
<strong>"+" and "-"</strong> Add or delete a Dashboard instance. Note, 
that an active Dashboard can not be deleted as the "-" will be grayed 
out. Configure a new instance by "Add"-ing instruments in the 
"Instrument" pane.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show this Dashboard</strong> If ticked just that Dashboard is shown. Toggling the icon displays all Dashboards.<br>
<br>
<strong>Caption</strong> changes the name of the DashBoard from the default "Dashboard" to the Caption value.<br>
Due to a wxWidgets bug, this change is not instant, and requires docking the Dashboard or restarting OpenCPN, to work.<br>
<br>
<strong>Orientation</strong> A dash board can be either Vertical or Horizontal.<br>
Vertical can be docked left or right, Horizontal can be docked top or bottom.<br>

<h2 id="WindHistory">Wind History</h2>
<br>
The Wind History Instrument needs some further explanations.<br>
<br>
<strong>The "wind history" instrument is meant to be run as a standalone (vertical) instrument</strong>.<br>
Just define a separate dashboard and add it as the only instrument.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/WH2.png" height="421" width="345"><br>
<br>
You can  resize the Instrument it with the mouse.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/WH.jpg" height="181" width="800"><br>
<br>
In real conditions, it monitors around 40 min of wind direction (red), 
as well as wind speed (blue), showing a vertical time line every 5 min 
(the example screen shot is a full-speed VDR replay).<br>
<br>
The text on the top shows the current values, as it is displayed in the 
standard instruments (blue = wind speed data, TWS=True Wind Speed, red =
 direction, TWD = True Wind Direction).<br>
<br>
Here is an explanation of the text line, left side (see screen shot):<br>
TWS 7.5 : true Wind Speed currently 7.5 kts<br>
Max 22.3 kts since 18:50 : this is the max Wind speed in the visible graphs, i.e. the last ~40 mins<br>
Overall 22.3 : the max wind speed since OpenCPN was started.<br>
<br>
Right side above :<br>
TWD 357° : True wind direction currently 357°<br>
<br>
The thin red/blue curves are the real direction/speed values, the 
thicker curves are smoothed values. Makes it easier to see trends.<br>
<br>
There is some logic included :<br>
The instruments re-zoomes automatically as much as possible, always trying to show the whole visible curve;<br>
Wind speed curve:<br>
if your max (visible) wind speed is 10 kts, then your scale is from 0...11 kts (rounded upwards to the next full knot).<br>
In the screen shot we had a mx of 22.3kts --&gt; scale is 0...23 kts.<br>
Wind direction :<br>
The instrument scale shows +/- 90° of the currently visible data values, but is limited to a total of 360°.<br>
If the wind is shifting through North (from 350, 355, 359, 002, 010, 
...) we're shifting the curve as well, meaning that there is NO vertical
 jump in the data from 360° --&gt; 0°, and we do NOT loose all the 
continuity in the smoothed curves !<br>
<br>
If you should happen to have more than a full 360° cycle of wind 
direction in the recorded data (if you sail through a couple of dust 
devils ), I limited the max scale to 360°, meaning that the curve will 
run out of the visible area on bottom or on top of the instrument.<br>
<br>
Please note that you don't have to have the instrument "open" all the time.<br>
Once activated as initially described, you can close it, and simply 
reopen it on demand. You don't loose the curves, the instrument 
continues to collect the data.<br>
To make it visible again simply right click on an existing  standard-dashboard, and click the "Wind History" Dashboard.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
OpenCPN has a grib weather file viewer plugin, aimed at being useful while under way.<br>
<strong>The grib plugin is always distributed with OpenCPN, no separate download is required.</strong><br>
<br>
 
<h3 id="What is a grib file?">What is a grib file?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you understand the basics, before you start to use them.<strong> It is essential to understand the limitations of weather forecasts that are distributed in the grib format.</strong> It is also worth pointing out that gribs are <strong>not</strong> reliable near tropical systems. Send a blank mail to <a href="mailto:GribWarning@saildocs.com">GribWarning@saildocs.com</a>. Read the mail you get back carefully.</li>
	<li>To get started with gribs and to find sources for downloads, check <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Grib-Files-Getting-And-Using">Franks-Weather.</a></li>
	<li>A very good, up to date book, is "Modern Marine Weather, second 
edition" by David Burch, with a thorough treatment of the subject.</li>
	<li>A few files including lectures on  tropical weather and gribs are available <a href="http://www.pangolin.co.nz/jetsam/view_article.php?idx=19">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
 

<h3 id="Getstarted">Get started</h3>

<ul>
	<li>To display grib files as an overlay on your normal charts you have to first activate the grib icon <img alt="" src="images/grib.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"></li>
	<li>Go to <img alt="" src="images/settings_003.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">
 find the plugin tab. Click on the Grib plugin, then the "Enable" 
button. The "Preferences" Button brings up a small dialog. The settings 
in this dialog rarely needs changing after the initial setup.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33GribPreference2.png"><br>
 
<h4 id="GribPreference">Grib Preference</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Use High Definition Graphics</strong>. The setting only 
concerns the barbed wind arrows.Tick the "Use High Definition Graphics" 
box, unless you are on old hardware. Not ticking the "High Definition 
Graphics" box can help to speed up the grib display, in such cases.</li>
	<li><strong>Use Gradual Colors. </strong>This setting applies to  all 
colored overlay maps. On many installations the difference in rendering 
is very small. The overlay maps built in color variation plays a part.</li>
	<li><strong>Copy First Cumulative Missing Record</strong>. This is about rainfall and cloud cover records .</li>
</ul>
As these records are "cumulative" , the first one does not exist in 
files from zyGrib and Saildocs. With this parameter unchecked, there 
will be neither rainfall and nor cloud cover displayed for the first 
date/time of the file. Ticking the box fixes the problem.<br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Copy Missing Wave Records</strong>. This only concerns wave
 records from zyGrib delivers files from two models ; FNMOC (WW3-...) 
for waves and GFS for all other parameters. These two forecast models 
does not have the same time spacing. For some dates/times, the wave data
 do not exist.This parameter allows this missing data to be 
reconstructed and avoiding the overlay (if set) to flicker.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="LoadFileOptions">Load File Options</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Load the More Recent File in Directory</strong>. Loads the newest file in the grib directory on start.</li>

<h2 id="TheGribDisplayControls">The Grib  Display Controls</h2>
 

<h3 id="TheStandardDisplayControl">The Standard Display Control</h3>
To start the Grib plugin press the <img alt="" src="images/grib.png" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> button in the tool-bar. The "GRIB Display Control" then pops up.<br>
<br>
<a href="#"></a><br>
<br>
This is a smart and compact dialog. For a quick start press the "Open 
File" button and navigate to your grib file directory and press the file
 to be displayed.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Previous/Next</strong> Go to the previous or the next 
record in the gribfile. This corresponds to the time "interval" chosen 
when the grib file was downloaded.</li>
	<li><strong>Data valid at</strong> The time of validity for all grib data on screen.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Grib file</strong> The name of the grib file in use.</li>
	<li><strong>Now </strong>Displays the record, nearest in time to "now" 
according to the Start option you have selected: ("Start at the nearest 
forecast to current time" or "Authorize interpolation to start at 
current time").</li>
	<li><strong>Zoom to Center</strong> This button will home in on the loaded area that the loaded grib file covers.</li>
	<li><strong>Play </strong>Goes through all records in turn, with the animation speed controlled in the "Grib Settings" dialog.</li>
	<li><strong>Progress Slider</strong> Just to the right of the "Play" button is a slider that is just another way of going through the grip records.</li>
	<li><strong>Open File</strong> Activates the operating systems standard
 file selector dialog to select a grib file. The plugin remembers the 
directory of this grib. This is used next time you start OpenCPN and 
activates the Grib plugin. See settings in the "Grib Preferences" dialog
 above.</li>
	<li><strong>Settings </strong>is where to control how the different grib data will be displayed. See more below.</li>
	<li><strong>Request </strong>Download grib files via email. More below.</li>
	<li><strong>GRIB Data at Cursor. </strong>This is where the "smart" part kicks in. <strong>Only entries for the data contained in the active grib file will be displayed</strong>.
 For example, if there is no wave data in the current grib file, there 
will be no signs of wave data at all. In the case above, where the the 
wave data is N/A, the grib file includes wave data, but not for the area
 where the cursor is. Compare with the picture below, where the grib 
only contains current data. The tick boxes next to each data entry, are 
used to activate the data-display on the screen. Exactly what will be 
shown is controlled in the "Grib Settings" dialog, which is reached by 
pressing the "Settings" button. Don't activate to many display features 
at the same time. The display quickly becomes very cluttered.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/33gribcurrent.png"><br>
<em>The "GRIB Display Control" loaded with a grib file only containing current data.</em>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Advanced GRIB Data at Cursor</strong>. The display options 
for all the data shown, can be reached by right.clicking on the little 
squares where the "ticks" are shown. For the meaning of all these 
options, read on.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/4gribControl.png"><br>
<em>Right-clicking the "Air Temp" option square.</em><br>
 
<h3 id="TheAdvancedDisplayControl">The Advanced Display Control</h3>
<br>
The plugin has an advanced mode were altitude data can be displayed. 
This mode requires some more knowledge than plain gribs. A good start is
 to read <strong><a href="http://vos.noaa.gov/MWL/dec_08/milibar_chart.shtml">"Mariner’s Guide to the 500 – Millibar Chart</a>"</strong>.<br>
If a grib file includes altitude data, the control will automatically include more options. See below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/500mb.png"><br>
If the dialog looks normal except for an extra selection box under "GRIB Data at Cursor", like this,<br>
<img alt="" src="images/std-grib.png"><br>
then the grib file contains altitude data. Selecting one of the 
altitudes, for example 500, changes the dialog to what you see above. 
The advanced data are displayed against a yellow background.<br>
<strong>Wind</strong>. These are the wind data valid for the selected altitude level.<br>
<strong>Grib Data at 500 hPa</strong>. The values at the selected level.<br>
 
<h2 id="WeatherTables">Weather Tables</h2>
<br>
Once a grib file is loaded in the current session, the "Weather table" appears in the right click menu.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33WxTable.png"><br>
<br>
Click the entry, and a Weather Table, valid at the cursor point, pops 
up. All available data in the current grib file, for the whole time 
span, are shown.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33WxTable_1.png"><br>
<br>
 
<h2 id="Settings">Settings</h2>
<br>
...controls how the grib files are displayed on the screen, and units 
used in the Grib Display control. Thing like Overlay colors, animation

The basic dialog looks like this.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribSettings.png">
<h3 id="Playback"><br>
Playback</h3>
The Loop Mode controls what happens when "Play" is pressed in the Grib Display Control.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Loop Mode</strong>. Sets the "Play" function into a loop mode. Otherwise, playback will stop when reaching the end of the file.</li>
	<li><strong>Loop Start</strong>. Were to start the loop. The option "Current time forecast" makes sure that only data now or in the future are shown</li>
	<li><strong>Updates per Second.</strong> Controls the speed of "play".</li>
	<li><strong>Loop Start</strong>. The loop can start either at the start of the grib file or from the current time forecast.</li>
	<li><strong>Interpolate between gribs</strong>. If you select this 
option, you will be able to choose your own time interval, but you have 
to consider that it can decrease data accuracy. To remind you, this info
 will pop up.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/33GribInterpolation.png">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Time Interval</strong>. This is the time interval used for 
interpolation. The entry is only visible if "Interpolate between gribs" 
is ticked. This is connected tho the chosen time interval when 
requesting a grib file.</li>
</ul>
 

<h3 id="Display">Display</h3>
The lower part of the Grib Settings Dialog, under the Display heading is
 really 10 different controls. The controls are activated  by the 
choosing one of the items in the selection menu below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribDisplayChoices.png"><br>
<br>
Many of the entries are repeated, so let's first have a closer look at 
the the most important one, the Wind. Entries on the same line are 
connected.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribWind.png">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Units </strong>refers to the choice of units for the selected record.</li>
</ul>
For wind speed the choices are.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33GribUnits.png">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Barbed Arrows. </strong>Display the traditional barbed arrows, showing wind direction and wind speed. <strong>Range</strong> refers to the distance between displayed arrows ( not working 3.3.1117). <strong>Default Color / Controlled Colors </strong> Default is dark brown while "Controled" varies from blue for very light winds to red for very strong winds</li>
</ul>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribControledColours.png">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Always visible</strong> This option only exists for "Wind" 
and "Pressure". When ticked the object is shown regardless of what is 
ticked in the "Settings Control". The idea is to be able to Show wind 
and/or pressure at the same time as other options. Use with Rainfall, 
for example, to help identifying fronts.</li>
	<li><strong>Display</strong> <strong>Isotachs</strong> shows contour lines connectAlways visibleing points with the same wind speed. <strong>Spacing </strong>controls
 which wind speed Isotachs will be shown. Use knots for units and 10 for
 spacing and isotach contours will be shown at 10 kts, 20kts and so on.</li>
	<li><strong>OverlayMap  </strong>Depending on your system capability,if
 you use "Accelerated Graphics (OpenGL)" (see General 
Options/Display/Advanced ), the overlay will be visible at all scales. 
But if you don't, the overlay will only be visible at small scales. A 
small yellow pop up at the bottom left of the <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/screen.html" title="View more discussions on Screen">screen</a> will inform you. Zoom out to a scale of 1:13 millions, or smaller to see them.</li>
	<li><strong>Colors</strong> is another selection menu containing 
pre-set color schemes. The idea is to use the scheme with the same name 
as the control, but this is just a hint, nothing more.</li>
</ul>
     <img alt="" src="images/33GribOverlayColors.png"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Numbers </strong>shows the wind speed in small square boxes. <strong>Minimum Spacing</strong> refers to the spacing between these boxes.</li>
	<li><strong>Particle Map</strong> is a kind of animation of the wind 
field. It is created by letting  "particles", or dots, move in the wind 
direction and leave a trail. The trail is colored after the wind 
strength, and each particle has a limited "life span". The<strong> Density </strong>slider
 creates particle trails that are shorter but closer together with 
increased value, which is the same as  further to the right.  The 
particle Map below clearly shows a convergence zone with stronger winds 
(red). Ths is probably a cold front.  <strong>Performance Warning</strong>:
 Note that high density Particle Maps on Low Powered Machines and Large 
Files may slow your machine to a crawl. First test on small files.</li>
	<li> </li>
</ul>
    <img alt="" src="images/ParticleMap.jpg"><br>
 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Overlay Transparency </strong>works as expected.</li>
</ul>
<br>
All the controls for Wind Gust, Rainfall and Cloud Cover, have similar entries; only the units differs.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribSettingsGusts.png"><br>
<br>
The pressure display has no overlays, only the options of isobars and numbers.<br>
Overlay Transparency is redundant.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribSettingsPressure.png"><br>
<br>
Waves and Current have a more or less similar display. A Particle Map is
 available for currents. See the ddescripion above for wind Particle 
Maps. Once again different units.<br>
There is a choice between three different display arrows shown in two sizes.<br>
If wave height, direction and wave period is present in the grib file it will be displayed in the Display Control like this:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribCurrent_0.png"><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribSettingsWaves.png"><br>
<br>
Air Temperature and Sea Temperature looks the same.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribSettingsATemp.png"><br>
<br>
Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) has these settings<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribSettingsCAPE.png"><br>
<br>
Altitude and Relative Humidity have a simple one choice entry.<br>
 
<h3 id="The new Grib-file Request Button">The new Grib-file Request Button</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Grib files can be requested directly from the plugin. The request 
is in the form of an email to SailDocs or ZyGrib. The requested grib 
file is also delivered via email.</li>
	<li>The area for which data is requested defaults  to the area visible 
on the screen, but the request area can be selected by other means as 
well. More below.</li>
	<li>It's possible to request gribs from 4 different Grib prediction 
models when using Saildocs GFS, COAMPS, RTOFS and indirectly WW3.  When 
you request "Waves" in GFS, Saildocs merge wavedata from WW3 into the 
delivered grib.</li>
	<li>The ZyGrib option can only deliver GFS gribs, which is the "standard" model for gribs.</li>
	<li>RTOFS gribs only contains current and water temperature data.</li>
	<li>COAMPS delivers wind and pressure with a higher resolution than GFS</li>
	<li>The minimum time between grib records are 3h for GFS and 6h for COAMPS &amp; RTOFS.</li>
	<li>GFS can be requested for 8 days ahead. An extended GFS request up to 16 days ahead is possible. This warning will  pop up.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33GFS16.png">
<ul>
	<li>The same value for COAMPS is 3 days and RTOFS 6 days.</li>
</ul>
<br>
There are two layouts of this dialog, depending on wether it is a 
request to SaiDocs or to ZyGrib. Some alternatives are only available 
from SailDocs, and some are only available from zyGrib. Alternatives not
 available are grayed out.<br>
<br>
<strong>The SailDoc Request looks like this.</strong><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribRequest.png"><br>
Compose the request by picking parameters and data. Not all data are 
available for all choices of parameters. For example, in the picture 
above "Wind Gusts" and "Current" are grayed out, as the are not 
available with GFS from SailDocs.<br>
<br>
When selecting <strong>"Moving Grib"</strong> the dialog expands and 
makes i possible to choose a speed and course. The selected grib 
forecast area will move, using these values, for each grib interval. The
 idea behind this is to minimize the download  while still covering a 
longer passage.<br>
Moving grib files are incompatible with interpolation, so if a "moving 
file" is detected a warning is displayed. Interpolation, if set is 
deactivated, but only for moving file, the settings as such, are not 
modified.<br>
<br>
The default geographical coverage of the requested grib file is the area
 you can see on the screen. A manual Selection Mode is also available.<br>
When the<strong> Area Selection</strong> -&gt; Manual Selection box is ticked the dialog expands<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribAreaSelection.png"><br>
<br>
Choose the limiting Latitude and Longitude for the grib-file manually or press "Start graphic Sel."  button.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/4GribGraph-Selection.png"><br>
Press the left mouse-button and draw a rectangle around the required area.<br>
<br>
When selecting <strong>"Pressure Altitude"</strong> and the GFS forecast
 model, the dialog expands and makes i possible to choose forecasts for 
different altitude levels. The SailDocs dialog only supports the 500 mb 
altitude, while zyGrib suports all options.<br>
When you are ready press  "Send".<br>
This message will show in the "Mail" window instead of the "send" request:
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>Your request is ready. An email is prepared in your email environment.<br>
			You have just to verify and send it...<br>
			Save or Cancel to finish...or Continue...</td>
		</tr>
	
</tbody></table>
As stated, a mail is composed for you and ready to send with your normal mailing program.<br>
This is the standard way of getting a new grib in Windows and Linux. (Mac ??)<br>
<br>
<strong>There is an advanced alternative</strong> for  Mac OSX, Linux (and BSD). Install and configure a mail server. Instructions on the <em><a href="#MailServers">Mail Servers</a></em> page. This will enable automatic transmission of a grib request to SailDocs.<br>
After installing and configuring a mail server, there is one more step.<br>
Open "opencpn.conf" and ad the line below. As always, do not run OpenCPN when editing opencpn.conf.<br>
 
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>[PlugIns/GRIB]<br>
			SendMailMethod=1</td>
		</tr>
	
</tbody></table>
Setting "SendMailMethod" to "0" restores the default.<br>
To get a grib, just press "send", and wait for a return mail.<br>
<br>

Warning!</h3>

<p><strong>This is an Advanced subject, that is not necessary for running the grib plugin.<br>
Do not try these setups unless you are familiar with your operating 
system, comfortable with handling the command line interface and editing
 configuration files.<br>
Do not expect these instructions to work without some customization.</strong><br>
<br>
This page contains detailed instructions on how to set up mailservers to automatically send grib request mails to Sail Docs.<br>
"Ptizef" has compiled the instructions for<strong> Windows (XP or XP)/Thunderbird</strong><br>
"Ptizef" has compiled the instructions for<strong> Linux/SSMTP.</strong><br>
"Cagney" has compiled the instructions for <strong>Linux/Exim4</strong>.<br>
"CarCode" has compiled the instructions for <strong>Mac OS X/PostFix </strong>.<br>
 </p>

<h2 id="WINDOWS">WINDOWS</h2>
<br>
1) Windows(Vista or XP and Thunderbird)<br>
<br>
- <strong>Outside OpenCPN </strong>there is nothing more to do except to
 ensure that there is a mail system (mine is thunderbird) correctly 
configured and set as "main" on the device.<br>
also verify if the mapi32.dll is present in c:/windows/system32 (or 
equivalent for 64b) (otherwise an error message will be the result).<br>
<br>
- <strong>Inside OpenCPN</strong>, there is nothing to do; the sender 
mail address can be entered, but will not be used. Just don't forget to 
enter the zyGRIB login and password.<br>
<br>
When clicking on "send" button :<br>
if the "main" mail system is not open, OpenCPN opens it and the waiting messages are received.<br>
remark : if there are many waiting messages, it could take a while. That
 is why it would be better to create a specific address for this 
purpose.<br>
Then a new mail page is opened with all mail elements already written thus ready to be sent.<br>

<h3 id="UsingSSMTP">Using<span dir="auto"> SSMTP</span></h3>

<p>How to install and configure sSMTP:<br>
<br>
- 1) Install the ssmtp package.<br>
If another MTA is already installed, it could be requested to uninstall it before installing ssmtp<br>
<br>
once it's done you could test by typing this command:<br>
"whereis sendmail"<br>
<br>
the answer should be something like that :"/usr/sbin/sendmail"<br>
<br>
use this answer in the next command:<br>
"ls -la /usr/sbin/sendmail"<br>
<br>
If everything's OK you should get this answer: "/usr/sbin/sendmail → 
ssmtp" showing that Sendmail function is now connected to ssmtp<br>
<br>
- 2) Now there are two files to set:<br>
<br>
the first file : /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf ( with root rights )<br>
<br>
The typical setting should be:<br>
root=postmaster<br>
AuthUser=yourlogin to your ISP access<br>
AuthPass=yourpasseword to your ISP access<br>
mailhub=yourISPserveurname.yourdomain (for example smtp.orange.fr)<br>
rewriteDomain=yourdomain<br>
FromLineOverride=YES<br>
hostname= the full host-name ( normally automatically entered, but if not you can type the command : "hostname" to get it)<br>
<br>
For ISP requiring a TLS connection , it could be necessary to add the line UseTLS=YES or UseSTARTTLS=YES<br>
<br>
the second file : /etc/ssmtp/revaliases (with root rights)<br>
<br>
Enter this line.<br>
root:yourlogin@yourdomain:yourISPserveurname.yourd omain<img alt="" src="images/tongue.gif" title="02_stick out tongue" border="0">ort<br>
<br>
the default port was 25 but now many ISP refuse it and use 587. If you 
have a mail system, you will find the right value in it.sudo 
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config<br>
Sendmail/Postfix install for Mac<br>
- Inside OpenCPN :You must enter the sender address : your entire mail 
address, the one you will use to send mails and receive answers<br>
<br>
When you click on the "send" button, the mail is directly sent. You can find the log here : /var/log/mail.log<br>
 </p>

<h3 id="Using Exim4">Using Exim4</h3>
First install Exim4<br>
$sudo apt-get install exim4<br>
then configure it (again).<br>
$sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config<br>
This is a very simple setup where exim is just used to forward mail to 
the ISP:s smtp server. Local system mail is also available.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail1.jpg" width="650"><br>
It's important to use the choice above.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail2.jpg" width="650"><br>
I just use "localhost".<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail3.jpg" width="650"><br>
We have no incoming connections.<br>

<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail6.jpg" width="650"><br>
This is important. It must point to your Internet Service Providers SMTP server.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail7.jpg" width="650"><br>
Your choice!<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail8.jpg" width="650"><br>
RTFM and make up your mind. Not a big deal for this simple setup.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail9.jpg" width="650"><br>
RTFM.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/33Gribmail10.jpg" width="650"><br>
Your Choice, but no point in splitting this simple setup.<br>
<br>
Edit /etc/exim4/passwd.client so it contains your username and password  to your ISP:s mail server.
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	
		<tbody><tr>
			<td># password file used when the local exim is authenticating to a remote<br>

<br>
It is not so easy to install this on a Mac since you will need some 
experience with terminal using. The example below uses an googlemail 
account and nano as editor:<br>
<br>
Step 1<br>
Type in terminal these 6 lines one after another with return:<br>
sudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool<br>
<br>
sudo gzip 
/usr/share/man/man1/{postalias.1,postcat.1,postconf.1,postdrop.1,postf 
ix.1,postkick.1,postlock.1,postlog.1,postmap.1,pos 
tmulti.1,postqueue.1,postsuper.1,sendmail.1}<br>
<br>
sudo gzip 
/usr/share/man/man5/{access.5,aliases.5,bounce.5,canonical.5,cidr_tabl 
e.5,generic.5,header_checks.5,ldap_table.5,master. 
5,mysql_table.5,nisplus_table.5,pcre_table.5,pgsql 
_table.5,postconf.5,postfix-wrapper.5,regexp_table.5,relocated.5,tcp_table.5,t
 ransport.5,virtual.5}<br>
<br>
sudo gzip 
/usr/share/man/man8/{anvil.8,bounce.8,cleanup.8,discard.8,error.8,flus 
h.8,local.8,master.8,oqmgr.8,pickup.8,pipe.8,proxy 
map.8,qmgr.8,qmqpd.8,scache.8,showq.8,smtp.8,smtpd 
.8,spawn.8,tlsmgr.8,trivial-rewrite.8,verify.8,virtual.8}<br>
<br>
sudo /usr/sbin/postfix set-permissions<br>
<br>
sudo chmod 700 /Library/Server/Mail/Data/mta<br>
<br>
Step 2<br>
Type in terminal another command to start the nano editor with this file:<br>
sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd<br>
<br>
Type into the nano editor:<br>
smtp.googlemail.com:587 YourAccountname@googlemail.com:YourPassword<br>
<br>
Substitute YourAccountname and YourPassword with your data.<br>
Save the file in nano with Ctrl-O and exit with Ctrl-X.<br>
<br>
Step 3<br>
Publicate the new file in terminal with this command:<br>
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd<br>
<br>
Step 4<br>
You have to edit the main config file and add at the end the following lines with<br>
this command in Terminal:<br>
sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf<br>
<br>
This to add:<br>
# Minimum Postfix-specific configurations.<br>
mydomain_fallback = localhost<br>
mail_owner = _postfix<br>
setgid_group = _postdrop<br>
relayhost=smtp.googlemail.com:587<br>
<br>
# Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP client.<br>
smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes<br>
smtp_sasl_password_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd<br>
smtp_sasl_security_options=<br>
<br>
# Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS), i.e. SSL.<br>
smtp_use_tls=yes<br>
smtp_tls_security_level=encrypt<br>
tls_random_source=dev:/dev/urandom<br>
<br>
Save the file and exit nano as in step 2.<br>
<br>
Step 5<br>
Now you can start postfix in terminal with:<br>
sudo postfix start<br>
<br>
If an error occurs correct main.cf and start again with:<br>
sudo postfix reload<br>
<br>
Step 6<br>
Now you can test your work in terminal with:<br>
date | mail -s test <a href="mailto:YourAccountname@googlemail.com">YourAccountname@googlemail.com</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Done.<br>
Supplemental<br>
If you want to have started sendmail/postfix each time you start you start<br>
your machine you can add these lines to the launch daemon:<br>
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;true/&gt;<br>
<br>
Do this with this command in terminal:<br>
sudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist<br>
<br>
After that this file should look like this:<br>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;<br>
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;<br>
&lt;dict&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;string&gt;org.postfix.master&lt;/string&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;string&gt;/usr/libexec/postfix/master&lt;/string&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;array&gt;<br>
&lt;string&gt;master&lt;/string&gt;<br>
&lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;<br>
&lt;string&gt;60&lt;/string&gt;<br>
&lt;/array&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;QueueDirectories&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;array&gt;<br>
&lt;string&gt;/var/spool/postfix/maildrop&lt;/string&gt;<br>
&lt;/array&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;AbandonProcessGroup&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;true/&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;OnDemand/lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;true/&gt;<br>
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;<br>
&lt;true/&gt;<br>
&lt;/dict&gt;<br>
&lt;/plist&gt;<br>
<br>
Instead of googlemail in this example you may use any other mail server.<br>

<br>
The bundled WMM2010 model expires on December 31, 2014.<br>
After then, if a new version of the plugin is not released in time, you 
will have to get a new WMM.COF from NOAA and place it in the location 
you can find in the OpenCPN logfile.</p>

<h3 id="A Quick-Start Guide."><br>
A Quick-Start Guide.</h3>
<br>
This plugin is all about the value of the magnetic variation. The value 
at your boat position, at the position of the cursor, and the rest of 
the world.<br>
<br>
Download and install the plugin. Go to Options--&gt;Plugins. Press the "Enable" button.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/WMM1.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Then press the Preference button, and copy the settings below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/WMM2.png"><br>
<br>
Press OK twice.<br>
The WMM icon will now be found in your ToolBar. The numbers in the button is the variation at your position.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/WMM3.png"><br>
<br>
Press the Toolbar Button and the small dialog below will appear on the screen.<br>
The first value is the same as in the button, the variation at your boat (gps) position.<br>
The second value is the variation at the position of the cursor.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/WMM4.png"><br>
That is all you need to know to get started, and for most of your daily use.<br>
Need more details? Read on!<br>
 
<h3 id="TheDetails">The Details</h3>
World Magnetic Model Plotting allows users to cross reference the magnetic deviation values printed on many raster charts.<br>
<strong>Variation</strong> is the angle between true and magnetic north.<br>
<strong>Inclination</strong> is the vertical angle of the magnetic field.<br>
A compass is adjusted for the inclination in the intended sales region.<br>
If you buy a compass in Europe; it will not be level in Australia, for example.<br>
<strong>Field Strength</strong> is the magnetic field in nano tesla from 20000 to 66000.<br>
Currently the total field strength is shown, with no immediate practical
 use. Hopefully this will change to show the horizontal component in the
 future, that has an impact on whether the compass works or not, near 
the magnetical poles.<br>
<br>
The plotted lines are similar to a topographic map.  The space between 
them can be adjusted; more space takes less time to calculate.<br>
<br>
The Step size and Pole accuracy sliders allow a trade off for speed vs computation time.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><strong>Climatology Plugin</strong><br>
<br>
Intended to aid in planning sailing voyages, to help visualize weather 
patterns, and to integrate with weather routing plugin to compute 
optimal sailing routes. Weather_routing plugin will use Climatology to 
make long voyaging routes.  This plugin goes well beyond what a Pilot 
chart provides.<br>
<br>
Manage and view monthly gridded Climate data compiled from various 
sources. Satellite weather data from the last 30 years is averaged, then
 represented using only useful bits, then compressed to produce a much 
smaller database used by the plugin.<br>
<br>
Climatology provides monthly data for Wind, Currents, Sea Level 
Pressure, Sea Temperature, Air Temperature, Cloud Cover, Precipitation, 
Relative Humidity, Lightning, Sea Depth, and Cyclones.<br>

<br>
<strong>Climatology Data Types with Display Options</strong><br>
Climatology has a number of Data Types. The display characteristics of 
each data type are controlled from the "Config" menu which first 
requires selection of the particular data type from a dropbox. Amoungst 
the display controls for each datatype are Enable/Disable, and to show 
the data as a "Overlay" which requires that OpenGL be enabled under 
Option &gt; Display &gt; Advanced.  The display options have been 
configured already for general use provided OpenGL is checked and should
 require no special configuration effort to be useful, however as users 
become familiar with the plugin, they may wish to change a setting for 
their type of use (such as if they do not have OpenGL checked.)<br>
<br>
The table below shows four data types that are normally shown in vector 
format and do not require that Overlay be checked, the other data types 
can also be configured to not require that Overlay be checked if OpenGL 
is not operational. Click for an englarged view.<br>

<strong>Installation of the Plugin</strong><br>
The plugin works with OpenCPN 3.2 and newer.<br>
<br>
   1. Windows: Download and run installer<br>
   2. Linux: dpkg -i &lt;package_name&gt;.deb or rpm -i 
&lt;package_name&gt;.rpm or cd /usr; sudo tar xavf &lt;package_name&gt; 
 <br>
<br>
<strong>Warning about use of Data:</strong><br>
Weather_routing is only as good as the data provided by the Grib plugin and the Climatology plugin.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Climatology plugin: </strong>Depends on a separate set of 
files that must be downloaded, extracted and placed in the proper 
directory.  Climatology data is generally averaged since the 1980's 
depending on data type and sources available (for example, Wind data is 
averaged 6 hr data since 1987). The entire source data set is over 180 
gb, however after averaging and compression it becomes about 7mb.   
There are various macro factors which affect weather over a given season
 which should be considered, including El Nino, Gulf stream, etc. 
Climatology has averaged these effects.</li>
	<li>These planning tools may be helpful, but should be taken with a 
healthy "grain of salt" as any good sailor (who looks out to the 
horizon) should know.  -Rick Gleason</li>

  <h1 id="WeatherRoutingPlugin" class="book-heading">Weather Routing Plugin</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><h3 id="WeatherRouting"><strong>Weather Routing</strong></h3>
This plugin creates optimized weather routes based on grib files and 
performance data (polar data) for the boat, as well as conditions set 
for time, where to start and where to finish.

<ol>
	<li>When downloaded, without changing anything, except downloading a 
recent grib file, defining two weather_routing waypoints (hover mouse at
 location, right click pick weatherrouting position),  create a new 
Configuration under Weather_routing, select Edit Configuration and add 
one of the waypoints to the start and the other to the end waypoint, 
click Grib Time, close Configuration, and Compute the new configuration 
and it will probably create isochrones and a new weather route.</li>
	<li>Use the Grib Plugin and recently downloaded grib files for completing grib predictive routing (1-8 days).</li>
	<li>Use the Climatology Plugin to find and plan long term cruising routes, (most useful in prevailing winds areas).</li>
	<li>Use both grib and climatology data to get current data if the grib 
does not contain it, or to use climatology to avoid areas of cyclones.</li>
	<li>It is also possible to use both grib and climatology data, allowing
 the grib's route to be extended past the time/range of the grib. This 
builds on the assumption that the current general weather pattern is 
"average", otherwise the result may be totally misleading. If you have 
followed the weather for a while and know the current weather pattern, 
through 500 mb patterns etc, this is more useful for actual routing than
 just using a long term average like climatology alone.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<strong>Create a New Route</strong>  (Edit &gt; New)

<ol>
	<li>Start the plugin by clicking it's icon on the toolbar.</li>
	<li><span>start and end points can be set by hovering cursor at a location, and right mouse click, select "Weather Route Position"</span></li>
	<li>Start Grib (with fresh grib file) and/or Climatology Plugins, and set the time to the desired starting time.</li>
	<li>Select Configuration -&gt; New to create a new weather route configuration.</li>
	<li>The Weather Routing Configuration Dialog should be shown.  Set the 
start and end positions and hit "grib time" to set the time.  Be sure to
 edit the boat to correctly configure it, see below.</li>
	<li>Beginners should first try a simple route, with starting point and 
end point, 5 degree steps, and possibly a 3 hour time interval until 
they see it is working.  The time interval depends on the speed of the 
boat and distance traveled.</li>
	<li>From the first Weather Routing Window, select Configuration -&gt; Compute.</li>
</ol>
<br>

	<li>Step duration for isochrones in hours and minutes (12 hours for long routes, 1 hour for shorter)</li>
	<li>Degree Steps  (5 degree steps is faster than 1 degree steps)</li>
	<li>Boat Performance based on editing boat specifications or based on a polar data file.</li>
	<li>Set constraints on various factors such as max wind, swell, waves, latitude, max diverted course etc...</li>
	<li>Set data source Grib or Climatology, greys if not available.</li>
	<li>Set options like detect land, currents, inverted regiions, anchoring.</li>
	<li>Routes can be Edited (created, selected, renamed, reset and exported.)</li>
</ol>
<img alt="" src="images/WeatherRoutingConfiguration1.jpg" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
<strong>Grib or Climatology Data is Required</strong><br>
Provided by use of the Grib_plugin and a fresh Grib file,  or by the 
Climatology_plugin with the separate Climatology data installed in the 
proper directory.<br>
<br>
<strong><img alt="" src="images/CCC-Castine-Grib.png"></strong><br>
<br>
When the weather route is displayed, grib and climatology calculations 
use different color schemes.  In the route below, on the left, using 
only climatology because we are outside the grib area.  In the middle, 
the computation is based on grib data, and toward the end of the 
passage, the grib data does not cover this time so again climatology 
data is used.  If the transition from grib to climatology is not 
uniform, then the climatology data is not as reliable in that situation.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Route Manager</strong><br>
The Route Manager can be used for listing the weather route.<strong> </strong>Right click a weather route and pick "Properties"  Also weather routing can be exported.<br>
<br>
<strong>Warning about Data:</strong><br>
Weather_routing is only as good as the data provided by the Grib plugin and the Climatology plugin.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Grib plugin</strong>: Depends on recent download grib files
 from Noaa and other sources. Downloaded Grib predicitions can change 
significantly over several days. The longer the grib prediction is, the 
less reliable the grib can be.</li>
	<li><strong>Climatology plugin</strong>: Can be used for analyzing long
 crusing routes through various seasons and constraints, but does not 
take into account the current weather conditions which often vary 
significantly from the 30 year average, especially outside of prevailing
 wind areas. </li>
	<li>These planning tools may be helpful, but should be taken with a 
healthy "grain of salt" as any good sailor (who looks out to the 
horizon) should know.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Warning about Weather Routes:</strong><br>
The weather routes created  may not consider or "see" normal navigation 
considerations and issues, therefore every route should be checked very 
carefully for navigation markers, shallow depths, bad currents, rocks, 
land and other obstacles and hazards.<br>

<font face="Arial"><b><u>Opencpn</u></b>  weather_routing_pi    and the required polar format<br>
<br>
The weather_routing_pi plugin references several files located in c:/ProgramData/opencpn.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">To see where these files are set in the plugin, select a route or make a new one. Pick Configuration --&gt; Edit.<br>
Then pick Boat  "Edit" a tabbed dialogue box will open.</font></font><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">"Plot Details" 
Tab  has Open, Save and Save as buttons. This is the pointer to the 
&lt;boat&gt;.xml file which contains the boat characteristics, it is 
initially set to "boat.xml".  After you have gone through all the tabs 
and set the boat's Lwl, Loa, Displacement, etc. you should "Save as" 
using your boat's name. Then "open" that file each time weather_routing 
needs those settings..</font></font><br>
<br>
Initially under &lt;Configuration &gt; Edit &gt; Boat Edit &gt; Plot Details [tab] the file referenced is "boat.xml". <br>
Make sure you have a file "boat.xml" in your opencpn data directory, if 
you are having troubles, download a boat.xml file and "load" it.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial"><font face="Arial"><font face="Arial">The second file
 is under &lt;Configuration &gt; Edit &gt; Boat Edit &gt; Polar [tab] 
and this is an optional polar file  "&lt;boat&gt;.csv"</font></font><br>
"Polar File" Tab shows the path of the Polar file being used, if one 
exists, otherwise the program has builtin VPP calculation using the 
boats characteristics which have been entered, which is in effect when 
the path shows as  "&lt;computed&gt;". <br>
<br>
If you have prepared a polar file in the Opencpn format for your boat, 
you can load it into the plugin from this tab, and after you "Save" from
 the "Plot Details" tab, the pathname willl be remembered   [note the 
pathname in the sample &lt;boat&gt;.XML file below].</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial">Sometimes the plugin is picky about these files. If it is close the plugin and opencpn and reopen, to reset it. Then try again.<br>
The two sample files are shown below. They are paired. If you load the 
XML file the referenced polar file will be loaded if it is in the path 
and the correct format.<br>

<div>Quote:</div>
<font face="Arial">A polar file is a sequence of lines. Each line describes the curve for one windspeed, <i>ws</i>.
 Optionally, the first line may begin with the string "pol", in which 
case it is treated as a comment line. This klunky format is not my idea;
 it is for compatibility with <i>Expedition</i> and other <a class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/software.html" title="View more discussions on Software">software</a> tools, and because it loads easily into spreadsheet tools such as <i>Excel</i>.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial">Each curve is described on one line of the text file 
by a windspeed, followed by a sequence of pairs of True Wind Angle and 
boatspeed. (TWA in degrees, BSP in knots)</font><br>
<font face="Arial">eg: </font><br>
<br>
<font face="&amp;quot;">10 30 0 45 6 90 8.1 160 7 180 5</font><br>
<font face="&amp;quot;">15 30 0 40 8 90 12 150 10 165 9 170 5</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial">This gives two curves, one for windspeed 10, one for 
windspeed 15. Different curves may have different TWA points, and 
different numbers of points. The line for windspeed 10 specifies a 
boatspeed of zero knots at a true wind angle of 30 degrees, a boatspeed 
of six knots at TWA 45, 8.1 knots at 90, seven knots at 160 degrees, and
 five knots at 180 degrees.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial">There can be a zero windspeed curve with non-zero boatspeed, i.e., “when the wind is gone, the motor's on.”</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Arial">Rules for the data in polar files:</font><br>
<font face="Arial">1) </font><font face="Arial">One windspeed curve per line.</font><br>
<font face="Arial">2) </font><font face="Arial">There must be a least 3 points per curve.</font><br>
<font face="Arial">3) </font><font face="Arial">There must be at least one non-zero windspeed curve.</font><br>
<font face="Arial">4) </font><font face="Arial">The minimum TWA is zero, and the maximum is 180.</font><br>
<font face="Arial">5) </font><font face="Arial">The 2nd smallest TWA in a
 line is the best VMG upwind angle for that windspeed. The 2nd largest 
TWA is the best VMG downwind angle for that windspeed</font><br>
<font face="Arial">6) </font><font face="Arial">The first TWA should be less than any 2nd TWA in any curve. Ideally, zero.</font><br>

<h3 id="Preparation"><br>
<strong>Preparation</strong></h3>
Install Weatherfax Plugin. Enable it in the Settings &gt; Plugin Tab.<br>
Then open it and explore the top menus.<br>
<br>
With an internet connection it is quite easy to select the "HF Radio 
Schedules" to select and set alarms for use with a reciever, or to 
select the Internet Schedules and then retrieve Weatherfaxes via the 
Internet and overlay on the chart. Audio Capture requires a connection.<br>

The plugin data directory contains an WeatherFaxInternetRetrieval.xml 
file that has database for meterological sites. The "Internet Retrieval"
 Option uses this schedule. It is a wonderful planning tool for cruises 
or passagemaking.  There are several options, but first Select 
"Internet" to retrieve HF Radio Schedules via the internet. Then Select 
"NOAA" Under "Servers" you will see "Stations" fill up. Then select 
"Boston" and the Internet Retrieval choices are automatically listed in 
the menu area.  Select several faxes and pick "Retrieve Scheduled" or 
"Retrieve Selected".<br>

Place these files in a new directory on your hard drive same directory as your Charts. I called the directory FaxWx.<br>
<br>
<strong>Open the Plugin</strong><br>
Then from the main screen select the Weatherfax Icon, a window pops up. 
Select Open and browse the  FaxWx directory and select a fax file. </div>

<h4 id="MercatorProjections"><br>
<strong>Mercator Projections</strong></h4>

<div>If the fax is a Mercator projection (orthogonal, not polar), click 
through the next screen that comes up and at the second screen set the 
coordinates and lat/long properly.  (Screenshots will be added later) 
and click on through to see the fax overlaid on the charts.  Note:<br>
It is very difficult to test for poor coordinate and lat/long input, so 
it is best to have your lat long correct, otherwise strange things may 
happen with the overlay in Opencpn. <br>
I first use a separate image viewer with the selected fax image, to zoom
 in and to write down the Lat/long and coordinates that I will be using.
   If you plan to export to a chart file then you should select "Get 
Aspect Ratio"<br>
<br>

<h4 id="PolarProjections"><br>
<strong>Polar Projections</strong></h4>

<div>There are other techniques used to modify a Polar fax onto a 
Mercator projection chart which are reviewed on the forum and will be 
more fully described later.  Review the posts following this <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/weatherfax-97533-18.html#post1185034">one</a> in the Forums. <br>
<img alt="" id="lightboximg7" src="images/attachment_003.jpeg" title="Weatherfax-Polar-NewTry-1.jpg; 1600 x 900 (@70%)" width="600"><br>
<strong><em>Coordinate </em>1 </strong>(Red) -Select a high latitude which must also lie on the vertical meridian running through the pole (N or S)<br>
<em><strong>Coordinate 2</strong> </em>(Blue) - Select an opposing corner (either side) with lower latitude.<br>
Then hit Get Map, the Blue circles should follow the latitudes of 
respective coords. Adjust the left/right location with the PoleX value 
and adjust the circle radius with the PoleY value. Set the True Width 
Ratio value to 1.0.<br>
<br>
From here, it should be possible to click "get mapping"<br>
<br>
<em><b>True width Ratio </b></em>- Adjusts the width of the blue circles
 (a fraction like .8 makes the circles wider, and 1.2 makes them 
narrower). Adjust the true width ratio such that the blue circles align 
with the associated latitude lines, otherwise the "Apply" transformation
 will not render straight lat/long lines or will fail.<br>
<em><b>Pole X</b> </em>- Moves the center of the blue circles left and 
right. The blue circles should be centered on the vertical meridian 
which goes through the pole.<br>
<b><em>Pole Y </em>-</b> Moves the center of the blue circles up and 
down. The blue circles should be centered on the pole. Hit get mapping 
to see how this is working, because the blue rings change in width, and 
sometime the ring closest to the pole flips if the value is too far out 
of whack.<br>
<b><em>Equator Y </em>-</b> This does not appear to do much when you change the value, more about this value later.<br>
<br>
If you are starting fresh with a Polar, and the blue rings are too wide 
after hitting Get Mapping, first check the lat/long entered and reset 
coords to be sure they are hit, then Hit 'get mapping again' then adjust
 the "True width ration" so the blue rings align with the latitude 
lines. Once that is done don't hit "Get Mapping" again, hit "Apply" the 
lines should be straight and orthogonal.<br>
<br>
Here is an example of a WxFax overlay in Opencpn<br>

<div>Image files that are downloaded and overlaid onto charts with 
specific coordinates, can now be saved as Kap files that save  long/lat 
and coordinates with the file.  The next step is to have the plugin read
 Kap files so they can be automatically overlaid on charts without 
having to use the Fax Translation Wizard.<br>

  <h1 id="GarminRadarPlugin" class="book-heading">Garmin Radar Plugin</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->The GRadar plugin works with modern Garmin (Ethernet capable) radar scanners only.<br>
<br>
The chart plotter is a combination of a Gps and electronic charts. If 
Gps works as expected and, a bigger if, the chart is correct, then 
everything is fine. Add a radar to the mix, with an independent picture 
of targets, including land, buoys and other vessels, and compare the 
two. That is what this plugin does. It overlays the radar-picture on the
 chart plotter. If both agrees, the navigator can be more confident that
 his navigation is correct. On the other hand, if the pictures 
disagrees, there is one more thing to sort out.<br>
<br>
<strong>To use this plugin the user must be familiar with both OpenCPN and radars</strong>. Without a sound knowledge in radar picture interpretation, the plugin will seem a bit confusing.<br>

interface in order to allow the OpenCPN application to access the 
Ethernet data captured and broadcast by the radar scanner.<br>
<br>
There are three interconnect scenarios possible, depending upon whether 
the installation includes an existing Garmin chartplotter, and the 
operational mode desired.<br>
Interface Type 0: OpenCPN Slave Mode, using existing Garmin chartplotter.<br>
Interface Type 1: OpenCPN Master Mode, using existing Garmin chartplotter.<br>
Interface Type 2: OpenCPN Master Mode, no chartplotter.<br>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><strong>Multicast UDP reception is needed to run gradar.</strong><br>
<br>
Step by step, simplifying the environment as much as possible ..<br>
OCPN 3.3.1303 now supports UDP Multicast of NMEA streams, thanks to Muttnik.<br>
<br>
To prove that your hardware is capable of multicast reception, do this:
<ol>
	<li>Two PCs, networked somehow (verify this please, by ping... ).</li>
	<li>Master PC has a GPS, slave is the device we are interested in.</li>
	<li>On master, set up a UDP output connection at address 224.0.0.8 (this is a well-known, benign and local-only multicast address).</li>
	<li>On master, set up a connection to receive your GPS input, whatever that may be.</li>
	<li>On master, open NMEA debug window and verify that you see BLUE UDP 
output to the specified port. UDP is connection-less, so will transmit 
without any receiver.</li>
	<li>Leave master running.</li>
	<li>On the second PC, which will be the Device Under Test (DUT), start 
OCPN 3.3.1303 with one UDP receive connection at the address mentioned 
above.</li>
	<li>Open the NMEA debug window, and look for GREEN UDP accepted messages.</li>
</ol>
If you don't see GREEN, then somehow the DUT cannot receive multicast....<br>
If you don't see GREEN, then we need Wireshark on the DUT to see what, if anthing, is coming over the wire.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>Windows 7 Details with a Garmin Radar and Gradar Plugin</strong></em><br>
<br>
The "Home" and "Public" network settings and firewall can create a 
situation where the Radar is broadcasting on the "Public" network and 
Opencpn is on the "Home" network, isolating the Radar UDP Multicast so 
that Opencpn will never "see" it.  If you want to keep your computers 
protected from attacks from the internet, it is best to make adjustments
 in the firewall to make an opening for just the Radar. As Helsmatt

</ul>
Comments following the success:

<ul>
	<li>Forgot you wanted to connect to internet via wifi, but now I am 
wondering why the Radar is on "Public".... I guess you can't log into it
 and direct it to a "Home" setup.... maybe its expecting to see a server
 or router with DNS rather than the more informal home network?</li>
	<li>Garmin chose a (fixed) multicast address which is in the "public" 
network space. Dunno why. So Win7 sees it as a public exposure.</li>
	<li>I wish we could [log on to the Radar]. That was our first approach,
 but even googling the issue, there was no solution to redirecting [the 
radar] to 'home'. Possibly something in the registry, but we don't need 
to do it that badly. We eschew messing with the registry. Anyway, we got
 it working, drilling some small holes in the firewall for gradar to 
peek through.....After all, I am a mechanical guy.....Every problem 
looks like a nail when the only tool you have is a hammer.....</li>
	<li>On both PCs we only had to plugin an active LA N connection, in 
this case, the Garmin radar cable (with associated hardware to control 
the scanner as described on OCPN. The PC sees activity and turns on the 
ethernet port. Can't do anything unless you have the radar attached and 
fired up, otherwise "network cable unplugged". In hindsight it was 
simple and fairly automatic once the firewalls were properly modified. </li>

  <h1 id="NavicoBroadbandRadarPlugin" class="book-heading">Navico Broadband Radar Plugin</h1>
  <!-- google_ad_section_start --><br>
The Navico broadband plugin will work with a Simrad, Lowrance or B&amp;G
 broadband scanner. All three models -- BR24, 3G and 4G -- are 
supported.<br>
<br>
The latest version available is 1.1, released on December 26, 2014.<br>
<br>
Binary releases are available at: <a href="http://opencpn-navico-radar-plugin.github.io/">http://opencpn-navico-radar-plugin.github.io/</a><br>
<span>Source code available here:</span><a href="https://github.com/canboat/BR24radar_pi"> https://github.com/canboat/BR24radar_pi</a><br>
 
<h3 id="Requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>The plugin requires API 1.10 and OpenCPN 3.3.<br>
<br>
The plugin requires OpenGL mode.<em> It does not work without OpenGL, and never will.</em> This means that a computer with good and fast OpenGL drivers is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="Hardwareinstallation"><br>
Hardware installation</h3>

<p>The Navico radars communicate with the chartplotters using UDP 
multicast. This means that they do not require any IP address. As long 
as there is a wired Ethernet path between the radar and the computer 
running OpenCPN it should work fine. A wireless connection is almost 
useless for two reasons: most wireless routers do not bridge multicast 
traffic, and if they do this is at the 802.11b base transmission rate of
 1 MB/s, resulting in loss of parts of the radar picture, making it 
unusable. One way around this would be to only enable faster 802.11 
versions.<br>
 </p>

<h3 id="Softwareinstallation">Software installation</h3>
<br>
There are installation packages that can be run using the installation tool for your platform.<br>
<br>
Once you have installed and restarted OpenCPN it should be available in the "Plugins" list in the configuration dialog.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/br24_preferences_097.jpg" width="500&quot;"><br>
<br>
Click the enable button, then close the options dialog. Unless you want 
to switch to kilometers or want to rotate the radar image there should 
be no need to access the preferences.<br>
<br>
Once you have enabled the plugin a new button appears on the button bar, looking like this:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/br24_button.png"><br>
<br>
The light will be red, yellow or green. Red means that the radar is not 
transmitting and that this is the desired state. Yellow means that the 
button has been pressed to switch the radar on but no data has yet been 
received. Green means that data has been received from the radar.<br>
<br>
Click on the button to open the radar control dialog and start the radar.<br>
<br>
The radar controls dialog is intended to be a small dialog that can be 
kept on-screen at all times.  If you have a small screen you can close 
the dialog and open it again either by pressing the radar button twice 
(switch off, switch on) or by using the context menu (right mouse click 
-&gt; Radar control.)<br>
<br>
If not all conditions are met to show an overlay it will show the following:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/br24_plugin_11_status.png" width="500&quot;"><br>
The OpenGL mode must be enabled. Go to <em>Options &gt; Display &gt; Advanced &gt; Graphics</em> to enable this.<br>
<br>
As you can see the overlay requires boat position (normally via GPS) and
 heading (via a compass). Heading via COG (when moving) is not 
recommended. You must set up NMEA connections either via a serial 
connection or a TCP or UDP or GPSD server.<br>
<br>
The radar will be searched automatically on all ethernet devices in 
turn. In the image above you see that the plugin is attempting to find 
it on a device with IP address 10.37.129.2. It will keep scanning at a 
rate of one per 2 seconds until it finds it. When it does it will update
 the control to show the radar IP address.<br>
<br>
Once the conditions are met and the radar is transmitting the radar 
control dialog allows you to change the settings of the radar (as shown 
on Windows XP):<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/br24_controls.png"><br>
<br>
You can access settings that should be needed less often by clicking<em> Advanced</em> (as shown on OS X with a BR24 or 3G):<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/br24_advanced_emu_osx.png"><br>
 
<h2 id="Controllingtheradarpicture">Controlling the radar picture</h2>
<br>
Whereas an AIS requires little help, a radar may need some tweaking to 
get the best picture. Not only that, the radar plugin can also be 
finetuned for specific circumstances.
<ol>
	<li>Range. Starts off as "Auto", which means that it shrinks and grows 
with chart scale. You can go from 50m to 48km or 1/20 NM to 36 NM with a
 4G radar and one step less with a BR24 or 3G.</li>
	<li>Gain. How much the return is amplified. Auto works quite well.</li>
	<li>Sea. Change this in a rough sea if the Auto setting shows too much noise.</li>
	<li>Rain. Change this in order to "see through" rain or to have dense rain show up.</li>
	<li>Advanced. See the next list.</li>
	<li>Guard zones. See the next chapter.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Advancedcontrols">Advanced controls</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Transparency. Use this to change how much of the underlying chart 
is visible through the radar image on overlay. It is not possible to 
change the 'z order' of the image with vector charts, so AIS images are 
always on top, then the radar, followed by the chart.</li>
	<li>Interference rejection. Increase this if you see spurious hard 
'spokes' of radar data in the direction of another ship that has a radar
 that 'jams' the picture. Keep low or off otherwise.</li>
	<li>Target boost. Increase to have small returns show up more prominently.</li>
	<li>Noise rejection (4G only). Controls the amount of noise filtering 
applied by the radar. Target sensitivity is increased at longer ranges 
when this control is set to Low or High, but does cause some loss of 
target discrimination. To get maximum range performance from 4G, set 
Noise rejection to High. You may need to lower noise rejection in areas 
of high interference.</li>
	<li>Target separation (4G only). Advanced technology in the radar 
enhances the definition of returns, especially at mid range. Suggested 
value: high.</li>
	<li>Scan speed (4G only). Increases the speed at which the radar turns 
to 36 rpm. If Noise rejection is set to Low or High, for ranges 1nm or 
higher, speed is limited to 24 rpm.</li>
	<li>Downsample. Generating the radar image may cause a lot of CPU if 
you have a weak OpenGL graphics card as every rotation contains 2048 
lines of radar data. By downsampling (ignoring a part of the data)  
fewer blobs are created, but the image becomes blockier. Suggested 
values are 1 to 4. 5 to 8 are there for tests.</li>
	<li>Scan age. If you have very weak hardware you may need to keep radar
 data onscreen for longer than the normal period. Increase beyond the 
default value of 4 if you have missing data and don't mind seeing older 
returns.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Guardzones">Guard zones</h3>
<br>
You can enable two guard zones. Enter values in the Guard Zone dialog to
 configure the distance and angle from the bow that you want scanned for
 'bogeys'. Once an echo is detected the alarm will sound every ten 
seconds until you press the <em>Confirm</em> button. Once you do the 
alarm will be silent until the guard zone is empty and a new echo 
arrives in the guard zone. As of 1.1 you can set up which alarm sound 
you want to use in the preferences dialog (<em>Options &gt; Plugin &gt; BR24radar &gt; Preferences</em>).<!-- google_ad_section_end -->  <div id="node-320" class="section-5">

<p><span>Of course you updated to the newest version first?<br>

<p><img alt="" src="images/br24_overlay_messages.png"><br>
 </p>

<h3 id="Noboatposition">No boat position</h3>
<br>
Check your GPS interface and/or NMEA inputs.<br>
 
<h3 id="Noheading">No heading</h3>
<br>
No compass data found. Check the NMEA inputs for HDT, HDM or HDG 
sentences. HDT is preferred. If none are available COG is used if the 
boat is travelling, but this is very bad for the overlay. Get a compass!<br>
 
<h3 id="Noradarpresent">No radar present</h3>
<br>
Is the system connected to the radar, either directly or via switch? 
Does the IP address of the network device show up in the "ZeroConf" 
line?<br>
<br>
If the radar does not transmit radar data but it is detected then the 
"Radar present" line will get a checkmark and the text will change to 
"Radar IP &lt;ip-addr&gt;". Check that this is the correct IP address.<br>
<br>
If the radar transmits data the dialog will change to the controls 
dialog, but the log file will still show the information such as IP 
address.<br>
 
<h3 id="EverythinglooksOKbutstillnopicture">Everything looks OK but still no picture</h3>
<br>
If you get the normal radar control dialog and the little 'light' in the
 radar button shows green, but you still do not get a picture, you can 
use the radar <em>emulator</em>.<br>
<br>
The emulator was created for debugging during development, but it can be
 used to check that your OpenGL driver is compatible and whether your 
system performs well enough. It uses (almost) the same code path as the 
normal UDP reception of radar data, but 'invents' an artificial radar 
image in 'standalone' mode.<br>
<br>
In the preferences dialog (<em>Options &gt; Plugins &gt; BR24Radar &gt; Preferences</em>) choose <em>Display Option</em> for<em> Radar display</em> as <em>Emulator</em>
 and close the preferences and options dialogs. You should now see a 
picture like this, even if you have fulfilled none of the overlay 
requirements:<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="images/br24_emulator.jpg" width="500&quot;">
<h2 id="It still doesn't show a picture">It still doesn't show a picture</h2>
<br>
Rats. Use the following to increase the amount of logging to the opencpn.log file:
<ol>
	<li>Click on the question mark in the button bar and note where the ini file (and log file) are kept.</li>
	<li>Stop OpenCPN.</li>
	<li>Edit the ini file and change the <em>VerboseLog</em> in the 
[Plugins/BR24radar] section to a number higher than 0. Values from 1 to 4
 are different. At level 4 your file will grow very quickly!</li>
	<li>Start OpenCPN.</li>
</ol>

<p>Check for the following if your emulator picture stays blank (at VerboseLog=2 or higher):</p>

<pre>18:58:35 CET: BR24radar_pi: 1415818715610 drawn 128 skipped 0 spokes with 14496 blobs maxAge=1487</pre>

<p>That line consists of a timestamp (milliseconds since epoch), the 
number of drawn lines (should be 128-2048 depending on Downsample 
setting), skipped (should be zero), number of "blobs" drawn and the 
maximum age of any radar data in milliseconds. If "drawn" is higher than
 zero, there is hardly anything that can be 'wrong' in the plugin source
 code. <br>

<h4 id="TypesofObservations">Types of Observations</h4>
Currently 3 types of observations are, more or less,  supported:

<ol>
	<li><strong>Altitude</strong> (sextant measurement) -- Measure the 
angle between the horizon and a heavenly body, and enter the required 
data in the plugin. Each measurement results in a Circle of Position on 
the sphere (COP, or Circle of Equal Altitude). Two or more observations 
result in intersecting COP's from which a position fix can be obtained.</li>
	<li><strong>Azimuth</strong> (compass measurement) -- Measure the 
azimuth (bearing) of a heavenly body. This method is hopelessly 
inaccurate, especially on a small boat in high seas. However, it is 
interesting for demonstration purposes, and possibly - with accurate 
digital compasses - it may be a viable navigation method in the future.</li>
	<li><strong>Lunar distance </strong>(sextant measurement) -- Measure 
the angle between two heavenly bodies. The computer then attempts to 
determine clock error from this measurement, and the system time may be 
corrected.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1. Obtaining Sights with Sextant">1. Obtaining Sights with Sextant</h4>
Standard practice in navy and merchant navy with regard to celestial 
positioning is as follows (assuming no artificial horizon is available 
on the sextant):

<ol>
	<li>During morning nautical twilight (about 15 minutes): if possible take 6 star/planet observations.</li>
	<li>In the morning at about 09:00LT: take a Sun's observation (later to be shifted to noon-time).</li>
	<li>At local noon: take a Sun's observation (traditionally only direct 
latitude calculation from sun at meridian passage). Construct a fix for

<h4 id="2. Sight Properties - Sight Tab - Enter Star Data">2. Sight Properties - Sight Tab - Enter Star Data</h4>
Enter Type (Altitiude, Azimuth, Lunar), Celestial Body, Limb, 
Measurement and Degrees of Certainty. Degrees of Certainty is the 
accuracy the navigator assumes for the observation. A larger value 
results in a larger line width for the Circle of Position on the chart. <br>

<br>
3. Sight Properties - Date and Time Tab</h4>
Enter Date, Time, Certainty and Shift. Note that entering a shift 
removes the calculated numerical fix. This is due to the computation 
method used, which presently does not allow to shift COP's. However, a 
position fix can be established by visualy observing the COP's (which 
are graphically shifted) on the chart.<br>

Showing the input figures and some calculated results for the 
observation. Together with the calculated numerical position fix showed 
in the main window of the plugin, this can be used for comparison with 
results that are obtained by other calculation methods (traditional 
manual method using logarithms, traditional or direct compution methods 
as mentioned in Nautical Almanac, shortened methods using e.g. US Pub. 
229 or US Pub. 249, other computer applications).<br>

7. Celestial Navigation Sights - Circles of Position and Sights</h4>
A Circle of Position (COP) indicates all the positions on earth where a 
navigator may observe the same altitude of a heavenly body at a certain 
time. Using traditional methods, only the part of a COP the navigator is
 interested in is used, and replaced by a tangent line (LOP).<br>

The MOB icon shows the initial DR position entered. The red circle 
indicates the intersection of the crossing red lines, the calculated 
position fix. Hover cursor over the crossing, right click and place a 
mark. If required, visually adjust this to get best latitude and 
longitude of the fix. In Sight Properties - Sight Tab, Degrees Certainty
 was set to 0.05.<br>

A general, but very clear text on celestial positioning is available in the PDF file on the web site of Henning Umland:

</ul>
Many thanks to Henning Umland for this concise text. Naturally, also the
 information provided by the Nautical Almanac and Bowditch is of 
interest (see 'Links').<br>
<br>
 
<h4 id="PluginComputationMethods">Plugin Computation Methods</h4>
The plugin is still under development and the computation methods used 
are innovative and based on vector, matrix and least squares methods. 
The author, Sean d'Epagnier, uses this innovative method to directly 
calculate a fix position. Only he knows the background and details.<br>
<br>
General information on direct computation methods can be found on pages 
277 to 285 of the Nautical Almanac 1994 (see 'Links') and in the 
following articles:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/sites/default/files/users/rgleason/JON58%282%29315-335.pdf">New Computational Methods for Solving Problems of the Astronomical Vessel Position (pdf)</a></li>

</ul>
Presently, the plugin is not capable of advancing COP's to a common 
time. When a shift is entered, the calculated numerical position on the 
main window disappears. In this case, the fix can only be established by
 visual examination of the graphics on the screen (see also 3. Sight 
Properties - Date and Time Tab, and 8. Four Circles of Position) and a 
fix time cannot be established.<br>
<br>
 
<h2 id="AccuracyofData">Accuracy of Data</h2>
 

<h4 id="ComparisionofPluginAstronomicalDataandNauticalAlmanacData">Comparision of Plugin Astronomical Data and Nautical Almanac Data</h4>
The data and formulae contained in the Nautical Almanac form a standard 
in itself. The plugin utilises astronomical data from VOP87d (for the 
planets and indirectly for the sun), ELP2000/82 (for the moon) and 
contains Right Ascension (RA; star's SHA = 360° - star's RA) and 
Declination (Dec) data for the selected stars.<br>
<br>
During development of the plugin, the calculated (intermediate) 
correction values for dip, refraction, horizontal parallax, parallax in 
altitude and semi diameter, as well as the calculated position fix, 
should be compared to values that result from other computation methods.<br>
<br>
The astronomical data used in the plugin is more accurate than data 
taken from the Nautical Almanac. However, for navigation purposes the 
differences are generally not important. With regard to altitude 
reductions, so far test data indicates that the differences found in 
calculated observed altitude (Ho) are small. Measurement and reading 
errors made by the navigator will be larger. Using the present version, 
calculated fix positions can still differ from those calculated with 
traditional methods.<br>
 
<h4 id="AccuracyofPluginAstronomicalData">Accuracy of Plugin Astronomical Data</h4>
The plugin astronomical data are from Jean Meeus' Astronomical Algorithms.

<ul>
	<li>Planetary positions are based upon a truncated version of Bretagnon
 and Francou's VSOP87 theory. The estimated maximum error in the 
heliocentric longitude is several arc-seconds. Geocentric positions are 
accurate to within a few arc-seconds.</li>
	<li>Lunar positions are calculated using a truncated version of the 
lunar theory ELP-2000/82 of Chapront-Touzé and Chapront. The estimated 
maximum error in the geocentric longitude is about 10 arc-seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="AccuracyofDatainthePrintedNauticalAlmanac"><br>
Accuracy of Data in the Printed Nautical Almanac</h4>
The largest error that can occur in GHA and declination of any body 
other than the Sun or Moon is less than 0.2'; it may reach 0.25' for the
 Sun and 0.3' for that of the Moon. In practice it may be expected that 
only one third of the values of GHA and declination will have errors 
larger than 0.05', and less than one tenth will have errors larger than 
0.1'.<br>
<br>
The errors in the altitude corrections are nominally in the same order 
(but the actual values of dip and refraction at low altitudes may differ
 considerably in extreme atmospheric conditions).<br>
<br>
Depending on the type of sextant, the reading accuracy of the sextant 
can be 0.2', 0.1' or 10". Measurement and reading errors made by the 
navigator will be larger.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
In this work, we employ a genetic algorithm, from the field of 
artificial intelligence, due to its superior search ability that mimics 
the natural process of biological evolution. Unique encodings and 
genetic operators designed in this study, in combination with the fix 
principle of celestial circles of equal altitude in celestial 
navigation, allow the rapid and direct attainment of accurate optimum 
vessel position. Test results indicate that this method has more 
flexibility, and avoids tedious and complicated computation and 
graphical procedures.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
This work presents a direct method for obtaining the latitude and 
longitude of an observer from the observed altitudes of two celestial 
bodies. No assumed position or dead-reckoned position or plotting is 
required. Starting with the Greenwich hour angles, declinations, and 
observed altitudes of each pair, the latitude and longitude of the two 
points from which the observations must have been made are directly 
computed. The algorithm is presented in the paper, along with its 
derivation. Two different, inexpensive, programmable pocket electronic 
calculators were programmed to execute the algorithm, and they do it in 
under 30 s. The algorithm was also programmed to run on a personal 
computer to examine the effect of the precision of the calculations on 
the error in the results. The findings show that the use of eight 
decimal places in the trigonometric computations provides acceptable 
results.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
In this paper, a simplified and direct computation method formulated by 
the fixed coordinate system and relative meridian concept in conjunction
 with vector algebra is developed to deal with the classical problems of
 celestial navigation. It is found that the proposed approach, the 
Simultaneous Equal-altitude Equation Method (SEEM), can directly 
calculate the Astronomical Vessel Position (AVP) without an additional 
graphical procedure. The SEEM is not only simpler than the matrix method
 but is also more straightforward than the Spherical Triangle Method 
(STM). Due to tedious computation procedures existing in the commonly 
used methods for determining the AVP, a set of optimal computation 
procedures for the STM is also suggested. In addition, aimed at 
drawbacks of the intercept method, an improved approach with a new 
computation procedure is also presented to plot the celestial line of 
position without the intercept. The improved approach with iteration 
scheme is used to solve the AVP and validate the SEEM successfully. 
Methods of solving AVP problems are also discussed in detail. Finally, a
 benchmark example is included to demonstrate these proposed methods.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Although many mathematical approaches to the celestial fix problem have
 been published, all of them fundamentally assume a stationary observer.
 Since this situation seldom occurs in practice, methods have been 
developed that effectively remove the observer's motion from the problem
 before a fix is determined. As an alternative, this paper presents a 
development of celestial navigation that incorporates a moving observer 
as part of its basic construction. This development allows recovery of 
the information on the vessel's course and speed contained in the 
observations. Thus, it provides the means for determining, from a 
suitable ensemble of celestial observations, the values of all four 
parameters describing a vessel's rhumb-line track across the earth: 
latitude and longitude at a specified time, course, and speed. In many 
cases, this technique will result in better fixes than traditional 
methods.<br>

<br>
You must use a proper vhf antenna, not the one included with the dongle.
  I cut the antenna coax included with the dongle, and spliced it to the
 vhf coax.  You must solder both inner and outer (shield) connections.<br>

You must now compile rtl-sdr from source:

<pre>
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git

Next, you must have either aisdecoder, or gnuradio (with gr-ais).<br>

The receiver program (rtl_fm) and decoder (aisdecoder) are included as 
pre-built binaries, so from here, install the plugin setup package.  So 
far I have no pre-built packages for gnuradio on windows, but this would
 be useful if provided.  If there are issues it may be helpful to 
install the sdrsharp program to determine if the dongle is receiving

From what I can tell so far, the error correction range is +- 128 (my 
two dongles use values of 35 and 50)  and must be within 5 for 
aisdecoder and 15-20 for gnuradio.  When the value is more accurate, 
more ais messages are received as well.<br>
<br>
From here, install the plugin package, or build from source and install.  <span>This works best in an area with a lot of ais traffic.  Once calibrated, ships should appear on the chart.</span><!-- google_ad_section_end -->  </div>

	<li><strong>Where is my log file? </strong><strong>Where is my config.ini file?</strong> Read this explanation - <a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></li>
	<li><strong>I can't find all those files you are talking about</strong>.
 A big contributing factor to this problem is that Windows default 
settings hides system files, and also by default, don't show file 
extensions. These settings can be changed however. In XP go to My 
Computer -&gt;Tools -&gt; Folder Options -View. Mark "Show hidden files 
and folders" and untick the box "Hide extensions for known file types". 
Other versions of Windows are similar, but may not be exactly like this.
 Now you should find the files we talked about in the previous 
paragraph.</li>
	<li><strong>I have a problem so I reinstalled - but that did not help. </strong>Try this approach instead - <a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></li>
	<li><strong>My charts used to show up just fine in OpenCPN, but using 3.0.2 and later, they no longer work.</strong>
 OpenCPN used to display charts with an unknown projection as a Mercator
 chart. The same thing applies to an "UNKNOWN" or not recognized 
geodetic datum, where OpenCPN used to default to WGS84. This is no 
longer the case. If OpenCPN don't recognize the chart projection, it 
will not be displayed. Potentially serious errors are thus avoided. The 
event is logged in the opencpn.log.  Users may run into problems if a 
chart projection is stated as "UNKNOWN" even though it really is a 
prefect Mercator chart. Unfortunately, some conversion tools take a 
shortcut and don't enter the "PR" tag in the kap-chart-header correctly.
 The projection of a chart can always be found, and the "PR=UNKNOWN" 
should always be avoided. Official charts that OpenCPN really can't 
display, with a latitude &lt; 70 degrees north/south, are very few 
indeed. Really only a handful of legacy, Gnomonic, large scale charts. 
Charts with "UNKNOWN" or blank geodetic datum are best avoided, they may
 be dangerously inaccurate.</li>
	<li><strong>I get a lot of error messages when starting OpenCPN from the Linux command line. </strong>  <br>
	Messages like
	<blockquote>ALSA lib pcm.c:2217:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM

	<li><strong>Why doesn't the plugin work?</strong>  See  <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/node/233">http://opencpn.org/ocpn/node/233</a></li>
	<li><strong>When will OpenCPN be ported to Android</strong>?<br>
	Once OpenCPN 4.0 is launched, expect some development in this area with
 the next beta series. A proof of concept using wxQT already exists.</li>
	<li><strong>Why does it take so long time to load vector charts?    </strong><br>
	The behavior you see is expected for ENC charts. ENCs must be converted
 to internal SENC format before use for navigation. This takes a little 
bit of time, depending on your system capabilities. But it only has to 
be done once, and the converted SENCs are stored on your system for 
later use.<br>
	All ECS systems must convert ENCs to SENCs. Some take longer, (like 
OpenCPN), so that subsequent access is faster. Some convert faster, 
leaving more work to do at the time of actual chart display. Its a 
design decision. OpenCPN is optimized for speed in real use, not for 
speed in conversion.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>What are all those 'U' things all over my chart?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The feature being rendered is S57 Text relating to 'M_QUAL'.</p>

<p>This is a meta-object describing the quality of data shown. The 
Attribute of interest is CATZOC, or "Category of Zone of Confidence". 
The value on most US ENC's is "6", or "un-assessed". Thus, the 'U'.</p>

<p>You can turn this symbol off in OpenCPN by de-selecting the box next 
to M_QUAL in 'Tool Box' / 'Vector Charts' tab 'Mariners Standard' 
selection list box.<br>
Unticking the box "Meta Objects" also hides the "U" symbols.</p>

<p>To learn the acronyms used in this application search the S57 'Object and Attribute' catalog at: <a href="http://www.s-57.com/" title="http://www.s-57.com/">http://www.s-57.com/</a></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>I have routes and way points in Sea Clear and I would like to import them into OpenCPN. Can I do it?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes. I had originally created and maintained all my routes and 
waypoints in SeaClear, exported them, loaded them into GPSUtility (for 
Windows) and saved them as text files.</p>

<p>To import into OpenCPN  I opened all my text files (routes and 
waypoints) with GPSUtility, saved that out as one big gpx file, and 
loaded it into OpenCPN. Works like a champ.</p>

<p>I've edited them and saved them back out as GPX files with no trouble.</p>

<p>Individual routes can be edited and saved in appropriately named GPX files.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Whenever I try to open a particular chart OpenCPN crashes. What's going on?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Chances are the chart file is corrupted. Note the name and number of 
the suspect chart and replace it with a fresh download. Read the log 
file that may contain relevant information regarding the chart. 
Sometimes the bad chart blocks OpenCPN from restarting. Follow these 
instructions instead - <a href="#InstallingOpenCPN"><em>Installing OpenCPN</em></a></p>

	<h3 id="I'm using Linux/Ubuntu and I hear no sound"><strong><a name="#"></a>I'm using Linux/Ubuntu and I hear no sound</strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>
Upgrade to 3.2. The sound problem was solved in Beta 3.1.1224, and should just work.<br>
The PortAudio sound libraries are included i OpenCPN and provides full ALSA support.<br>
Sound on Windows and Mac are not changed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Background</strong><br>
The earlier implementation of Linux sounds is described below. It was a  mess.<br>
OpenCPN uses a simple sound feature available in wxWidgets, wxSound, 
that uses OSS (Open Sound System) to play sounds. If OSS is not 
available, SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) will be used instead. It has 
no support for ALSA!<br>
With version 11.04, Ubuntu dropped the OSS support and the OpenCPN "sound problem", started<br>
OSS is replaced with ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) on newer 
Linux distributions, and Ubunt. This is for good reasons. AlSA replaced 
OSS about 10 years ago!<br>
Similarly the libwxgtk2.8-0, that OpenCPN relies on, is not compiled 
with support for SDL in the Ubuntu version. The same applies to many 
other Linux distributions.  This is the core of the sound problem, when 
using OpenCPN on Linux.<br>
<br>
How to get sound to work?<br>
There are a few options available. Starting with the easiest......<br>
<br>
1.  "aoss" is a "wrapper program" that catches OSS sound and 
"translates" it to the default ALSA sound system. Ubuntu does not 
install "aoss" by default, but can be added using "sudo apt-get install 
alsa-oss".<br>
To use "aoss" just start OpenCPN from the command line like this:<br>
$aoss opencpn<br>
To make it easier, write a shell script containing the single line 
above, and make it executable. Change the link (icon) where you normally
 start OpenCPN, to point to the new script.<br>
<br>
2 "padsp" works  similar to "aoss", using the "pulseaudio server". It's 
available when the "pulseaudio-utils" package is installed. To get sound
 in OpenCPN start this way from the command line:<br>
$padsp opencpn<br>
Of course, this can be scripted as well, as for "aoss".<br>
<br>
3. Install a version of libwxgtk that includes support for SDL. Such versions are available from <a href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists" title="http://apt.wxwidgets.org">http://apt.wxwidgets.org</a>. OpenCPN 3.0.x requires the minimum version of  ibwxgtk2.8-0 to be minimum. 2.8.12, for all features to work as expected.<br>
Download the correct package for your version of Debian or Ubuntu. 
Unfortunately the latest Ubuntu versions are not included, but 
"squeeze"(strictly a Debian package) is a good candidates. Goto <a href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/">apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/</a>, and select 32 or 64 bits version. For example, the latest 64 bits package is <a href="http://apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/binary-amd64/libwxgtk2.8-0_2.8.12.1-0_amd64.deb">apt.wxwidgets.org/dists/squeeze-wx/main/binary-amd64/libwxgtk2.8-0_2.8.12.1-0_amd64.deb</a><br>
Download and then<br>
$sudo dpkg -i ibwxgtk2.8XXXXXX (the proper name of the downloaded version), to install from the command line.<br>
Alternatively, simply clicking on the package is enough on many Linuxes.<br>
In both cases you may have to force "upgrade" to a lower version than the existing package, depending on your installation.<br>
<br>
Once you have installed wxgtk with support for SDL, as described above, 
open Synaptic, find the installed package. Mark it an then goto 
"Package" and tick the "Lock Version" box. This is to prevent that your 
newly installed wxgtk will be replaced by a version with a higher 
version, that lacks support for SDL.<br>
Do not try to update your system from the command-line, as "apt-get" will not respect the "Lock".<br>
<br>
4. You can also recompile libwxgtk and include support for SDL. Not for the faint of heart.<br>
<br>
5. It is possible to compile your own kernel and include support for 
OSS, but this solution is not for the faint of heart either.<br>
<br>

	<li><strong>OpenCPN and Great Circle Navigation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Raster charts display bearings and headings as straight, measurable 
lines on the chart. Similarly, Vector ENC's are rendered as Mercator 
projections in OpenCPN and most other ECS's for the same reason.</p>

<p>For typical coastal navigation, errors which occur using rhumb line 
instead of great circle calculations are small for the distances usually
 covered by one chart.</p>

<p>Mercator Charts and Mercator navigation is the standard for most 
navigational purposes. Other terms used instead of "Mercator Sailing" is
 "Loxodrome Sailing" or "Rhumb Line Sailing".</p>

<p><strong>As of OpenCPN 3.2.0 Great Circles are handled directly</strong>, Great Circle Routes can be used as explained on <a href="#PlanningData"><em>Planning Data</em></a> page in the wiki. There is also a plugin available as well as some <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/node/133">Supplementary Software</a>  to handle great Circles.</p>

  <!-- google_ad_section_start -->Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br>
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA<br>
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
 share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
 make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public 
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and 
to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free 
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
 License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
 be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a 
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
 the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers 
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means 
either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is 
to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is 
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute 
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. <br>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
 or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
 to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the 
terms of this License. <br>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
 the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
 appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
 else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user 
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
 interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
 based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) <br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
 can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
 the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
 License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, <br>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
 give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
 performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
 corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange; or, <br>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only 
for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
Subsection b above.) <br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
 means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special 
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
 the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the 
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise 
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
 who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will 
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
 its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
 so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
 any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who 
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
 could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely 
from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
 by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
 the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version 
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
 Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the 
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the 
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
 DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
terms.<br>
<br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey 
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.<br>
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author<br>
<br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License<br>
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2<br>
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details<br>
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome<br>
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' <br>
for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
 you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright<br>
interest in the program `Gnomovision'<br>
(which makes passes at compilers) written <br>
by James Hacker.<br>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you 
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications 
with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser 
General Public License instead of this License.<!-- google_ad_section_end -->  </div>
